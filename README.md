quiet discourse
===================

This is an online compendium of sorts for all things affiliated to the MyAnimeList club [Quiet Discourse](http://myanimelist.net/clubs.php?cid=40791). This repository logs the following:

* `/club-comments` all text from the club's club comments
* `/irc`: all IRC chat history from the [#qd](http://client00.chat.mibbit.com/?channel=%23qd&server=irc.rizon.net) channel on Rizon
* `/quiet-discourser`: all issues of the weekly newsletter (and for free!)
* `/scripts`: all scripts used for general functioning of the club
* `/threads`: all text from the club's forum threads

There is also the ever awesome [QD wiki](https://github.com/nil-/quiet-discourse/wiki/_pages), which currently holds the Archives, Nomination Tallies, and a general todolist for the club.
