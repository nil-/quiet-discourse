		  Say you have a list of 1000 unscored anime, but you've watched so much bad porn that you want to separate them from all the good anime. So you score your list as yea or nay. You look it at your "yea" titlesâ€”that's all cool because you can easily distinguish what you think is good or bad.<br />
<br />
But now you realize you don't want to put Totoro on equal footing with Summer Wars. They're both "good" but I clearly think one is much better than the other. So you partition your "yea"s into "yea" and "more yea". But then you realize you don't want to put ... on equal footing with... </td>

		  I started removing scores a few months ago whenever I felt that they didn't reflect how I felt about something and after a while I realized that I was almost exclusively removing the scores of things that I liked and didn't feel like I had an appropriate score for. Then, a couple weeks ago, I decided to remove what was left of my 9s, and 10s because I really couldn't differentiate between the two. The 7s and 8s followed soon after. Although I was pretty sure that I had a good grasp of the varying tiers of badness that the bottom of my list represented, I'm starting to doubt those scores as well. (What makes Master Keaton a 1 and Yugo the Negotiator a 2 when they're basically the same godawful show?) I'm thinking about switching to just using 3, 5, and 8 or something along those lines to just convey generally positive/negative/ambivalent feelings towards things.</td>

		  I'm not sure about removing scores from reviews. I usually read reviews with different scores to get an overall picture of the work through different opinions. It would be a lot harder to find positive and negative reviews in a sea of words.<br />
I see the review problem more in the system MAL uses rather than in the score itself. <br />
<br />
Scoring my animay has always been fun for me. I don't really feel troubled by scores when watching anime and never had the impression that my eventual score would change my enjoyment of a show while watching it. And as Nabby said, scores can be pretty useful for certain things.</td>

		  I like explaining my scores with mini-reviews on the list and also expanding the score with - and + ratings, so I think the system becomes much more informative that way. I wonder who even cares about that, but I have 8000 list views (anime+manga) somehow. <br />
<br />
As for the method of rating, I usually wait until the show is over, so midway through I don't keep focused on what rating to give it. <br />
And I hate those reviews that give the final score by making a mean of the minor scores, I think it's a very unfair method. I take some points into account (originality, writing, themes, characterization and narration) but build up other criteria over them or break them down into other points, and I don't think a story has to succeed on all of them, but what matters in the end is how much the plot structure exceeded on their use to achieve something.</td>

		  Personally, I rate things for my own benefit. Keeping ratings as a scale of basically "how much did I enjoy myself watching this" makes it a useful, interesting way to keep tabs on how my tastes change over time and what kinds of things I find interesting in anime. I can make more accurate statements about how I feel about certain things, for example when people say "this season wasn't very good in comparison to previous seasons of anime I have watched" and with my scores I can pretty accurately say whether or not I really do feel this way or if a few good/bad shows are heavily influencing how I am interpreting a much larger set of anime. I also prescribe to the thought that my scores can be a decent quick-glance indicator of how I feel about shows, and any following discussion that is tainted by those scores being the focus isn't the fault of the score existing but what the other person chooses to do with it. If the exact score is the real focus of the conversation, we were never really talking about the anime anyway.</td>

		  So many replies!<br />
<br />
"Scores are not the perfect way to express our opinion, so let's not express our opinions at all?"<br />
<br />
No one said this, nor anything even remotely similar. Like Excelsior said, even a short tag saying "this had a bad story" is worth infinitely more than mere 4/10. There's a lot between condensing everything into numbers and writing a lengthy essay for every single anime. There are more ways to express yourself than number/10. I personally don't care for weighing works against one another, as I feel it's inherently unfair. I sorta went into this in the genre thread though, so I'll leave it at that.<br />
<br />
The point about it inspiring conversation is one I can't really agree with, at least not in a general sense. They seem to inspire confusion more than anything, for many of the reasons Excelsior detailed in his second paragraph. I guess that confusion can inspire conversation, but these conversations still tend share the incredulous "yeah, but <em>that</em> rating???" tone. Even through words, the conversation subtly revolves around this silly number stuff. Yeah, there are exceptions, many of them even, but this is what I've observed to be most common.<br />
<br />
Great posts though! I find myself mostly in agreement with Excelsior, but everyone brought up some great points. Especially Veronin's point about scores in reviews. They have absolutely nothing of worth. Ultimately, for me, I still don't think it's worth it--I found them detrimental to the way I watch and appreciate anime--but I can see why others still bother. </td>

		  Scores are not the perfect way to express our opinion, so let's not express our opinions at all? I say take the good with the bad. I need to record my opinion on things. Awarding scores allows me to filter all the 2010 anime in my list and see quickly which are those I found most recommendable. It allows me to filter all fantasy titles and be reminded which I found to be the top of the genre. It allows me to measure works against one another, roughly, but even after a period of time.<br />
<br />
But I don't only need to record my opinion for myself; other people are also interested in it, and chances are, they're interested in my opinion for way more entries than I have the time and ability to write essays for. So I rate. And it doesn't prevent me from writing a few reviews and MAL posts on top of it. The clever will understand that ratings are the incomplete expression of my thoughts and will not take them as any more than that. The dull will fixate on ratings and react unintelligently, but those who fixate on ratings are unlikely to provide a good quiet discourse in the first place, even if I didn't award scores.</td>

		  Scores are useful for me since it eliminates the "Hey, what did you think of X?" and "How did you think X compared to Y?" Being bombarded with questions about every single anime is a pain. And while a number is not going to provide any of the reasoning that led to your conclusion, it does at least give an indication of what your tastes and preferences are like. It encourages discussion rather than confusion ("<em>why</em> did you feel this way?", as opposed to "<em>how</em> did you feel about it?) You can't write an essay for every anime in a list environment so numbers suffice. <br />
<br />
It's also an easy way to sort your list when it reaches a certain size. You can sort by highest and lowest scores in order to find the shows you liked or enjoyed least. If you have no scores, you have to look at each entry one-by-one and rely on memory. Recommendations become virtually impossible. <br />
<br />
I'm all for eliminating review scores, though. They have no reason to exist. The argumentation is already there unlike with your MAL list. Professional websites pretty much do it for the traffic since the majority of people are dumb and can't read more than a Twitter-sized offering.</td>

		  There are various motives as to why people rate things, some may do it to reaffirm their own experience with the said work, some probably do it to display how methodological they are, or to show off their individual preferences, but why do I rate things? It's probably out of habit by now.<br />
<br />
When someone joins a listing site such as MAL, there is a high probability that they have only just started their anime experience, and as you pointed out, RMNDolphy, the motive for rating things in the beginning may be to get to know new people, or just because it seems fun. But as the list gets bigger there appear more and more rating inconsistencies, rating things becomes tedious, and even possibly a subject of personal attack for some, that's all true. But the real question is, why do <em>you</em> bother that much with such trivialities?<br />
<br />
When your ratings stop being something you compare to other people, and simply a measure of personal enjoyment/evaluation, what does it matter if your rating system is "flawed", ratings only become orientational pointers of sorts, they certainly won't change your personal experience with some work. As I said previously, rating things is only a habit for me now, and I don't bother pondering how minute to minute changes may affect the overall score of something, the big picture of things is what matters in the end.</td>

		  @RMNDolphy<br />
<br />
Ratings <em>are</em> pretty damn deeply problematic and annoying. They're inherently reductionist and hierarchical and flawed. It's true that complex and mutli-faceted thoughts can't be summarized by just plopping down a number of "x/10".  <br />
<br />
It's also problematic that these numbers mean different things to different users and each person has a different standard for rating. When a person rates something 10/10, what does that mean? Is historical influence being factored in? Or """""objective"""" qualities? Or is it only representative or pure enjoyment? And if a user places, say, Detroit Metal City and Clannad and LOGH all at 10/10, that's even more confusing. Putting all three in the same numerical placement is meaningless because all of those three series have vastly different goals and purposes and, most likely, that user would have vastly different emotional reactions to each work. If this hypothetical user were to cry at Clannad and laugh heartily at DMC and justify it by saying that both deeply moved him, how can one just attach a number to that emotional depth (going back to that whole reductionist shtick)? And does that mean that that user has different rating standards for even different works  of different genres (as tenuous as genres already are!)? <br />
<br />
And it seems that there's so many internal inconsistencies in rating systems when one looks more microscopically. All series have separate more nuanced goals, don't they? A-and how can something like bad animation be forgiven in something like LOGH but not forgiven in something like Aku no Hana? Tangential to that is just how users can hierarchically rank series into things like "Favorite anime in order from 1-10". The fact that each rating system has different standards for various arbitrary categorizations and classifications and that users attach these different complex thoughts to numbers which can't be summarized without nuanced writing does make these ratings seem almost meaningless.<br />
<br />
And, personally, it's hard to justify ratings when things like tags and notes and reviews exist. Even tagging a work with a simplistic "The story is bad" is more meaningful than "4/10".</td>

		  1. Words are bad.<br />
2. Taking ratings seriously, whether it be obsessing over scores for hours or dismissing them for not being sufficient, is silly.<br />
<br />
Is the so-called "oversimplification" not the """""point""""" of a rating system? Ratings are meant to provide someone's tastes at a glance, so everyone doesn't have to read some sort of lengthy bibliography. They foster discussion for those who are actually interested.<br />
<br />
(here comes one of my bad analogies!)<br />
In that sense, a list is like a synopsis. If a synopsis of a work interests you, you go and watch/read/whatever it. If a someone's ratings interests you, you go and ask him why he rated Code Geass a 10 despite having Anime Patrician (ç¬‘) tastes.</td>

		  That's fair. To be clear, I'm not against episodic discussion at all, though I do feel the emphasis should be on the whole rather than the part. That's another discussion though. I've just noticed people boiling that discussion down to numbers. Constantly thinking about how each niggling thing docks a point and what have you. It seems to me they're denying themselves an integral part of the experience by being ""critical"" during the episode, rather than after it. I know not everyone who rates anime does this, but I have noticed things trending towards that fairly often, even in myself when I used to rate anime. Numbers are dangerous, yo.<br />
<br />
"But personally, I just like to see everyone's hand before showing my cards."<br />
<br />
That's probably the best thing going for scores. It's a super flawed system, but it can be a (foggy) window into peeps you might want to converse with. It might even serve as a good starting point for discussion! BUT, I rarely see it work that way. It's usually the source of unfound aggression, not quiet discourse. People get entirely too worked up about a stupid number when they should be trying to get into the ideas behind that stupid number. Is this a flaw with those people or the number system? I dunno, but considering my other problems with the system, I find myself leaning towards the latter. I still feel the cons outweigh the pros.<br />
<br />
Also, my previous comment came out more like an attack than I wanted it to. I'm just genuinely curious more than anything.</td>

<br />
I don't think anyone would dispute weighing each category differently depending on the work. But I only score things in my reviews out of obligation, and would write without an <em>overall</em> score hanging over the reader's head if that was allowed.<br />
<br />
But I'd also leave the scoring option open. Back when I used my list normally, ratings were a way to quick note my thoughts on a show. For convenience over profundity, 'cause having analytical thoughts at the ready for everything I've watched would be Kill la (over)Kill.<br />
<br />
And I was never, and still not, big on the episode by episode discussion approach. But I think the value there is more about just talking with other anime fans in general, since Discourse is half the fun for a lot of the fandom. And, let's face it, a need to be "current."<br />
<br />
But personally, I just like to see everyone's hand before showing my cards.</td>

		  I don't have the patience to nominate this and I'd lose interest by the time it goes up anyway. Why do people rate things? <br />
<br />
It seems dumb to me to reduce complex, multifaceted thoughts and feelings towards a work into a single number. To deem a bunch of disparate works (each with their own distinct strengths, weaknesses, approaches, etc) something like "8/10" is beyond oversimplification and seems lazy to me. Words are a much more powerful tool than numbers.<br />
<br />
I also think scoring categories individually like on MAL reviews is idiotic. For story, animation, etc to always be given the same weight is to ignore how appropriate/important each is for their respective anime, and the varied ways they work with and against each other. The importance of each varies wildly from one work to the next. <br />
<br />
I've also noticed a sort of unhealthy way of watching anime fostered by people preoccupied with scores. People spend an episode reflecting on how minute things change the way they'll score it rather than allowing themselves to be swept up in it. The idea of that seems anti-art to me. Peeps worked hard to make these worlds/stories for an audience to become immersed in; it's disrespectful and in some cases inhibitive to think of the whole thing in terms of arbitrary numerical values. You're ignoring a fundamental part of the work when you do this. <br />
<br />
The only tangible benefit I see to it is giving someone a passive sneak peek into your tastes, but the cons outweigh the pros, I think. It goes beyond simply be imprecise. So I'm curious why people do it.<br />
<br />
So hey, you. Why do you do it?</td>
