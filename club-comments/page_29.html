		  Mushishi had a pretty great first episode, and JoJo is off to a great start as well. Mahouka might be interesting, I mean the setting isn't original at all but it could work providing it doesn't fall victim to the various number of cliches that it could so easily fall to. Isshuukan Friends surprised me, it didn't try to be anywhere near as emotional as I thought it would, and provided that the anime doesn't go down the Kotoura-san route, it could be a solid show...maybe. Plus the art style is kinda nice. <br />
<br />
Matsutarou surprised me a lot actually especially given all the negative backlash it's received so far. It's pretty good! A very fun show. Matsutarou reminds me of Pete from pretty much any Disney short with his mischief and I think it'll be interesting to watch him (potentially) change as a person. It's interesting to see a show that's about sumo wrestling too, especially one by Tetsuya Chiba - it kind of seems like a somewhat lighthearted version of Ashita no Joe. Sumo wrestling looks fun :))))))<br />
<br />
Akuma no Riddle is pretty weak. It's pretty dark and edgy with mediocre animation, if there's actual yuri within the next couple of episodes then I might stick with it.<br />
<br />
Of course I'm still waiting for Ping Pong to blow everything out of the water. </td>

		  Haikyuu is at least very nice to look at in animated format, more money seems to have gone into it than with Kuroko from the looks of things. I'm hoping that the animation stays this nice all the way through, I actually really enjoy the manga so seeing it get an anime with good production values is a nice thing. <br />
<br />
Also Stellio, Haikyuu isn't actually ridiculous. I don't really know all that much about volleyball but I know that it would have been all too easy for the author to start throwing out special moves and insane spikes that would have made it really dumb. At this point in time, Haikyuu seems legitimate (although if there's anyone out there who actually knows anything about volleyball at all then feel free to prove me wrong). </td>

		  Well, Black Bullet was crap. The whole damn thing was 90% exposition, and the remaining 10% is a mixture of Psycho-Pass and Attack on Titan, plus giant zombie insects. Also, the female lead is awful.</td>

		  If I had to be frank, Haikyuu is what I think to be Production I.G.'s foothold to making some more $$$. I mean, with Kuroko no Basket's great success, and the fact that Haikyuu is going to be another adaptation with some already dedicated fans, it's kinda hard not to see it that way. I love me some sports anime nonetheless, and I bet other studios will catch on over time and, for instance, make an anime about Ping Pong or something. <br />
<br />
However, I do theorize time to time that this is merely Production I.G bulking up some extra cash. And eventually, I hope they dedicate their time to making something new (non-sports related, in other words). I mean, honestly, Kuroko no Basket and even Haikyuu's first episode weren't bad at all (I rlly like KnB as well), but next thing you know, a golf ball will fly out of Earth's atmosphere only to pierce right through a NASA facility on its way down, but then, getting intercepted by an airplane, finally lands right in the hole for a birdie, or something. Oh yeah, and all done in a Elementary School tournament. <br />
<br />
Most shows have a lot of potential this season, like Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou, Isshuukan Friends, <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">and Nisekoi.<!--strike--></span> But it's really a mixed bag. My most anticipated shows are both airing on the 11th so, yeah.<br />
<br />
Also, Dolphy pls. Gokukoku no Brynhildr probably isn't gonna be worth your time to argue against, unless you want to re-watch Elfen Lied as well (considering how bad your memory is). I have the same problem with Gokukoku as another excellent anime called Strike Witches: there're cute girls and a bigger, grander narrative, but they are very, very disconnected. And most of the time, the latter will be ignored in lieu of the focus on the cute girls. And, with Strike Witches, dat focus is on the arse, while Gokukoku on an eventual, histrionic romance drama that isn't really original or interesting. In other words, don't watch it unless you want a half-baked show with half-baked Sci-Fi stuff and cute girls + half-baked romance.</td>

		  I guess I'll do my thoughts on the Spring 2014 Season as well along with an initial score.<br />
<br />
<div class="spoiler"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.nextSibling.nextSibling.style.display='block';this.style.display='none';" value="Show spoiler"> <span class="spoiler_content" style="display:none"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.parentNode.style.display='none';this.parentNode.parentNode.childNodes[0].style.display='block';" value="Hide spoiler"><br><br />
Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - I felt that this was just going to be the next Sakurasou no Pet na Kanajo with more shiny colours. For those who don't know what Sakurasou is about, it's about a group of unique people all living in a dorm. (6/10)<br />
<br />
Blade and Soul - This didn't feel interesting nor did it feel like the characters were moving as if it were their actions. It felt more like certain words and actions had to be fulfilled so they just did so, but seeing as this is based off a game. It didn't surprise me. (5/10)<br />
<br />
Selector Infected WIXOSS - The concept of the anime of the anime is weird seeing as being able to continuously win a card-game they will become a person who will be able to make wishes come true but if they lose 3 times, they will lose that priviledge. (5/10)<br />
<br />
Mushishi Zoku Shou - Erm... Awesome! It's back guys, Rejoice! (9/10)<br />
<br />
Akuma no Riddle - I feel like this is going to be one of those weird anime where nothing makes coherent sense yet the anime tries to make it seem that way. It was like a mix between Danganronpa and Medaka Box. (4/10)<br />
<br />
Seikoku no Dragonar - Mixed feelings towards this anime. I don't hate it, on the contrary, I liked it but it was no very good of an anime. The concept of the anime seemed a little off as well being that it's about people summoning dragons yet the protagonist summons a girl. Oh, how typical of anime. Reminded me a bit of Dog Days. (5/10)<br />
<br />
Kamigami no Asobi - Well, looks like there's another reverse harem... with the gods? And a shrine maiden? And...? Wah? At least they won't, I hope, have as many males as Brother Conflict. At least it's not incest this reverse harem time around. (4/10)<br />
<br />
Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei - The concept is interesting but is kind of resticted and ruined by the school setting. Also, the protagonist -- aka the brother, also made friends exceptionally quickly without having to do a single thing. I feel that the anime would flow and be so much more interesting if they stayed away from school. (6/10)<br />
<br />
Captain Earth - My hatred of the mecca genre doesn't shine through as it would some of the other anime of the same genre, even one I dropped purely because I saw some kind of robot (from this season). Not too sure about this one, but props for making me watch the whole episode and not having a cringe fest. Not too sure about the score for this one because it's influenced by my surprise of getting through the episode. (7/10)<br />
<br />
Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii - I had to think about what this anime felt like. It felt a bit like Romeo and Juliet; but with four daughters on the other side whilst the "Romeo" side of things were that of the norm. Curious to see how they develop this anime further and the interactions between the couple which seem to be soon wedded. I hope they don't forget about the characters that appeared in the first episode. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Haikyuu!! - My god. Production IG really knowns how to make you pumped for an anime. I think this anime will treat as well in the abscence of Kuroko's Basketball since he needs half-year breaks only to go for another half-year. (8/10)<br />
<br />
Gokukoku no Brynhildr - Unsure what this anime was trying to do with it's first episode but it had scenes that I could say I genuinely enjoyed. As for the rest, having the protagonist (try?) to devote his live in order to prove aliens exist in his childhood-friend's place since she died seemed kind of unnatural. I'd also wish they'd seriously stop with the time-skips where the characters are old enough to be in high-school. (6/10)<br />
<br />
Baby Steps - I'm curious to see how the relationship will or won't develop between the two MC's. I like the concept of the studious person learning something in a way which normally wouldn't be done, especially by themselves at the age he is. Other than that, I'm a fan of sports anime so I get compelled to watch anime that's related to any type of sport. This season.. so much sport. (6/10)<br />
<br />
Isshuukan Friends. - This is my cup of tea. I don't think there has been an anime that has one of the MC's constantly forgetting things, well, at least not in the same manner as this. The art and overall feel of the anime is remeniscent that of Usagi Drop. I think this may be one of those anime that isn't particularly good but as a special place where it shines within me. Or, it is very good and I will love it. (7/10)<br />
<br />
Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season - I'm not quite sure why I'm watching this. I'm gone. I'm blank. I have nothing to say. (5/10)<br />
<br />
Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to the Animation - Just a kick-back anime because it's half the duration of the average episode. (6/10)<br />
<br />
Kanajo ga Flag wo Orarctara - Looks like this anime won't make much coherent scence seeing as a girl feel down one floor and her death was prevented by her falling in love because our, oh so special, protagonist kisses her. Not to sure what to think about the two characters that seem to be the focal point of the anime since there does seem to be some chemisty between them but it's lacking something. (5/10)<br />
<br />
Black Bullet - I didn't like the way they executed the first episode. I wonder how it's possible to even try to fit all the mumbo-jumbo into one episode to try to explain the situation and everything else whilst trying to do it in a round-about way. If they weren't so blatantly obvious if trying to force feed us information, I would have liked it. Potentially a four, but between that and five, I chose five. (5/10) <br />
<br />
Soul Eater Not! - Just as the name implies. It's not Soul Eater. Although some characters from the parent anime are in it, the art and the way everything was presented was kind of out of place. Maybe I was too focused on how it differed from the parent anime. The preview for the next episode doesn't look like the anime will go anywhere soon. (5/10)<br />
<br />
Other anime that I won't watch or haven't seen for varies reasons:<br />
-Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders<br />
-Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo Returns<br />
-Majin Bone<br />
-Kenzen Robo Daimidaler<br />
-Kiniro no Corda: Blue Sky<br />
-Abarenbou Kishi!! Matsutarou<br />
-Yu-gi-Oh! Arc-V<br />
-Oreca Battle<br />
-Dragon Collection<br />
-Hero Bank<br />
-Dragon Ball Kai (2014)<br />
-Mahou Shoujo Taisen<br />
<br />
If anyone thinks that I should watch any of these, disregarding the first two (sequels) please tell me.<br />

		  I actually liked Aberenbou Kishi!! Matsutarou a lot. The first episode was really fun. Anticipating how this one goes forth. Mushishi is just as great as ever. Really looking forward to Ping Pong and Date A Live.<br />
<br />
I haven't checked out much else. Baby Steps was very by-the-numbers and underwhelming, but I'm willing to give it a few episodes. It had alarmingly low production values for a first episode. Mahou Shoujo Taisen is... inoffensive? I miss Gainax ;_; <br />
<br />
Captain Earth is p much the only other thing I've watched, and that was awful. All of the dialogue was really unnaturally expositional, yet still made little sense. Too much technobabble. It's really muddled up in flashbacks but none of them were particularly meaningful. I guess it's trying to be intriguing? I was left uninvolved and confused though. Honestly, I expected a lot more out of Yoji Enokido. It wasn't even fabulous :(<br />
<br />
I still plan to check out Haikyuu, because sports; Kanoflag, because it looks really, really dumb; and Gokukoku no Brynhildr, so I can argue with Stellio.</td>

		  We're only one episode into the new season BigSumo. I'd say give it some time, you might find something surprises you. Plus more Mushishi and more JoJo's are right up my alley. That's two winners in my book. If there's at least one show that gets me excited then I'm having a good time.</td>

		  This season is a disgrace so far. All my thoughts in the spoiler..<br />
<br />
<div class="spoiler"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.nextSibling.nextSibling.style.display='block';this.style.display='none';" value="Show spoiler"> <span class="spoiler_content" style="display:none"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.parentNode.style.display='none';this.parentNode.parentNode.childNodes[0].style.display='block';" value="Hide spoiler"><br>GREAT:<br />
Mushishi S2<br />
<br />
OK:<br />
Haikyuu!! - pretty enjoyable first ep. great animation. typical sports shenanigans, but well directed. this will probably get more enjoyable as we get into it.<br />
Isshuukan Friends. - kawaii show with kawaii characters. they are one dimensional, but the interactions are enjoyable. it will be fine so long as it steers clear of major drama.<br />
Kantoku Fuyuki Todoki - a show about hideaki anno from his wife's perspective? yes, it is as ridiculous as it sounds. very funny.<br />
<br />
BAD:<br />
Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii - i would have dropped this, but i'm curious to see what the main character and the main male character's interactions are like. if they're funny/enjoyable, it may be worth watching. i somehow doubt it though, if the other aspects of ep 1 are anything to go by.<br />
Gokukoku no Brynhildr - the only reason I didn't drop this is because it was so idiotic that it became really really unintentionally funny. a really poorly made show. i hope it continues in the spirit of episode 1. based on a manga from the elfen lied guy too, so you can guess what this is like.<br />
<br />
STUFF I DROPPED:<br />
Aberenbou Kishi!! Matsutarou - cool art style (background art), but dumb humor and boring premise<br />
Baby Steps - not bad, just really bland and unoriginal (which i guess is bad in a sense)<br />
Black Bullet - unexciting run of the mill action show complete with random unmemorable monsters, loli sidekick/fiance, and other 'colorful' characters<br />
Blade &amp; Soul - actually not too bad, just the kind of action show that does nothing for me. a cool setting that is glossed over, characters that are flat as hell (large boobs though). If you need some mindless action though, this is where to find it<br />
Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou - A bunch of stereotypes live together and ecchi problems arise (just read the synopsis for this and you will understand)<br />
Captain Earth - I may pick this back up, but it's a less fabulous, and therefore quite dull, version of Star Driver. nothing else that stands out about it really.<br />
Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara - a low-budget and exceedingly dumb harem anime. i didn't make it very far into this, because the MC had a "I don't want to hurt anyone anymore" line followed by a flashback of the main female character's 'tragic' childhood or something....i didn't hang around to find out what it actually was<br />
Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei - this season's overhyped and overrated blandfest. probably the dullest first episode of the season, and the main character and his sister's relationship just should not be a thing.<br />
Mahou Shoujo Taisen - no idea what happened in this. it looked like it would have beautiful animation, but it didn't. it was retarded.<!--spoiler--></span></div><br />
<br />
Ping Pong, Knights of Sidonia, Mekaku City Actors all promise to be something worth watching. Who knows, Hitsugi no Chaika and No Game No Life may end up being enjoyable too.</td>

		  I finished majority of the Winter 2014 season except for a select few which are either sequels (or had an ova before the series) or Robot Girls Z.<br />
<br />
If I were to nominate two anime for reviewing it would have to be Noragami and Mikakunin de Shinkoukei (Married to the Unidentified) with a special mention to Nagi no Asukara (Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea) which aired in the Fall 2013 season but ended in the Winter 2014 season.</td>
