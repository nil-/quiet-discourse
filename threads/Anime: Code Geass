Anywho... yeah.  This was actually the very first anime I ever saw.  Luckily, I liked it (even R2, lol), and stuck with anime as a result.  And here I am.<br />

It's been a while since I've seen the series, so I won't be able to fairly describe the positives of the anime as mainly the negatives stuck out over time. I found Code Geass very bad. It required me to suspend my disbelief many times for really big blunders, of which here are some examples:<div class="spoiler"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.nextSibling.nextSibling.style.display='block';this.style.display='none';" value="Show spoiler"> <span class="spoiler_content" style="display:none"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.parentNode.style.display='none';this.parentNode.parentNode.childNodes[0].style.display='block';" value="Hide spoiler"><br>- Lelouch saves the Japanese by having a Britannian representative say they'd grant Zero asylum, and then have all the Japanese cosplay as Zero. The unintentional comedy is strong. They would all have gotten shot thanks to this brilliant plan had it not been for Suzaku conveniently intervening.<br />
- Mao came back to life after being shot dozens/hundred of times because "Britannian medicine is very good" and "Zero ordered his minions to shoot at him, not to kill him".<br />
- On the other hand, Britannian medicine could not save Euphemia from a single wooden bullet.<br />
- When Euphemia was bringing about an early happy end to the series, the writers came up with the single most terrible way to kill her- the Geass randomly activating at the same time as Lelouch saying "I could for example tell you to kill all the Japanese..."<br />
- Notice that this untimely drawback of the Geass was soon removed from the plot (thanks to the lenses) after it served its purpose of killing Euphemia. One wonders why CC didn't give these lenses to Mao, as well.<br />
- Mao isn't the only character coming back to life. It is never explained how in the world Nunnaly survived the bombing. Guilford was seen being caught in the explosion yet reappeared in the final episode. Suzaku was supposedly killed by Kallen in a mecha fight at the end of the series, but he came back with no explanation.<br />
- There is no mention of the Knights of Round in the first season, yet they are main antagonists in the second season.<!--spoiler--></span></div><br />
And here are a few- among many, I think. I'm really focusing on one aspect of the series, but I'd also recommend <!--link--><a href="http://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=52936">Baman's article</a> that has a different, more comprehensive approach. I don't agree with everything he says or suggests, but he makes some thought-provoking notes.<br />
<br />
I remember really liking the soundtrack, though. Particularly <!--link--><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P75vosW_Rw8" rel="nofollow">hitomi</a>'s songs. Overall the songs really made for a good atmosphere.</div><div style="margin-top: 8px;"><em>Modified by lpf, 04-12-14, 6:54 AM</em></div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

<br />
Here we have a show that takes the tried and tested formula of Sunrise mecha, blends in some Real Robot and Super Robot tropes and gives us a series that through mixing a wide variety of genres (in true Full Metal Panic fashion) manages to be an extremely appealing show regardless of genre preference. The show is rather interesting in its approach to various themes and extensively developing certain characters, no doubt the most crucial of them being Lelouch. Hell, I'd argue that not liking Lelouch is the equivalent of not liking the show itself.<br />
The various themes the show covers are varied and all fleshed out to some extent, ranging from imperialism to nationalism's hypocrisy to what it meant for Lelouch to fight as Zero. The series is however very flawed and the plot and certain events have to be taken with a grain of salt, as  Ipf kindly presented for us above. I nevertheless believe that, as a piece of pure entertainment as well as a thought provoking series in terms of themes, Code Geass goes beyond its initial purpose and delivers one of the most powerful messages to come out of anime (that lying to achieve a greater purpose is not an evil thing to do) and easily one of greatest finales in anime history. <br />
It has plot holes, it gets a bit too ahead of itself with its plot twists and I can certainly see why many people dislike it, if not outright hate it. But Code Geass nevertheless is a series that catches the attention of the viewers and is among the most emotionally gripping series I've ever seen, and very few anime in general and mecha in particular stand out from the crowd as much as this one.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><img class="userimg" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/8NuZt.png" /></div></td>

It is, however, not a mindless fun show.<br />
You know what I mean? Yeah, it's a fun show, but I can't consider it good, because it takes itself seriously. It's not an over-the-top nonsense for the sake of entertainment like Hellsing Ultimate or Gurren Lagann, it's a political story with inconsistent tone that keeps going for highschool bullshit, the strategies are far-fetched and rely on the villains being idiots, the worldbuilding doesn't make sense, Suzaku is a hypocrite, and the worst part: R2 reaches a whole new level of asspull fest with Charles' plan, Suzaku's superpowers, magic that pops out of thin air, the Zero Requiem, people were supposed to be dead and are suddenly alive, magical contact lenses, and so on.<br />
<br />
lpf pointed out some plot holes, but there are many more. Why the hell would Lelouch jokingly tell Euphemia to kill all the Japanese? And how much of a coincidence can it be that the Geass evolved at the same time (note: it was never foreshadowed that the Geass could do that)? Why would Lelouch destroy a faction of Japanese that could help his plan and he still pretends to be doing it right? WHY [insert 100 other situations here]?!<br />
<br />
This show a is a joke. Watch it only for mindless over-the-top fun and don't try taking this nonsense seriously like it does to itself.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><!--link--><a href="http://myanimelist.net/clubs.php?cid=35120"><img class="userimg" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/MkmghXm.jpg" /></a></div></td>

<br />
Here we have a show that takes the tried and tested formula of Sunrise mecha, blends in some Real Robot and Super Robot tropes and gives us a series that through mixing a wide variety of genres (in true Full Metal Panic fashion) manages to be an extremely appealing show regardless of genre preference. The show is rather interesting in its approach to various themes and extensively developing certain characters, no doubt the most crucial of them being Lelouch. Hell, I'd argue that not liking Lelouch is the equivalent of not liking the show itself.<br />
The various themes the show covers are varied and all fleshed out to some extent, ranging from imperialism to nationalism's hypocrisy to what it meant for Lelouch to fight as Zero. The series is however very flawed and the plot and certain events have to be taken with a grain of salt, as  Ipf kindly presented for us above. I nevertheless believe that, as a piece of pure entertainment as well as a thought provoking series in terms of themes, Code Geass goes beyond its initial purpose and delivers one of the most powerful messages to come out of anime (that lying to achieve a greater purpose is not an evil thing to do) and easily one of greatest finales in anime history. <br />
It has plot holes, it gets a bit too ahead of itself with its plot twists and I can certainly see why many people dislike it, if not outright hate it. But Code Geass nevertheless is a series that catches the attention of the viewers and is among the most emotionally gripping series I've ever seen, and very few anime in general and mecha in particular stand out from the crowd as much as this one.<!--quote--></div><br />
I couldn't have put it better.<br />
<br />
I am of the firm belief that Taniguchi Goro, the man behind Geass, knew <em>exactly</em> what he was doing the entire time. I'm not going to argue against people who think the show is bad, because yes it is frequently illogical and full of coincidences. BUT, I don't like to call the twists and turns 'asspulls'. I think the show is purposely ridiculous in this respect, and that the goal from the beginning was to continually up the ante, with every twist outdoing the one preceding it in terms of sheer idiocy. <br />
I don't have any proof that this was the case, but I think Goro is a very talented director, and based on the other two shows of his I've seen (Planetes + Infinite Ryvius), I feel he has a very strong sense of direction and progression. Planetes in particular is a show founded on logic and (half of the time) realism. It is one of the best in this regard. Code Geass is the complete opposite. It wouldn't make sense for the man who directed Planetes to direct a completely illogical show and not realize just how illogical it all was. I just don't see it.<br />
<br />
Besides Goro, there were two other dudes who played a role in Geass' story composition. Those two went on to make Guilty Crown, a show that attempted to use the model of Code Geass and implement the same twists and turns, yet which failed miserably. Why? Because those two didn't understand what Goro was doing. They thought all you needed was a mass of cliches and asspulls. They were wrong.<br />
Ok, so I'm heavily assuming things here, but it makes sense to me to think of it like this. I feel such a strong emotional connection to Code Geass. I have watched it THREE TIMES all the way through, and my third viewing was by far the most enjoyable of the three. I thought that by then all the 'flaws' would expose themselves, that its stupidity would get on my nerves. This didn't happen.<br />
I've always wondered what it is that allows someone to watch Code Geass while suspending their disbelief. I know a lot of Code Geass fans are the same people that love shit like Naruto and Attack on Titan, and it makes me feel like a fool. But there are quite a few people who are in the same boat as me - usually I struggle with anything illogical in visual media. I like to think I'm good at separating the positives from the negatives; I have a strong grasp on when an anime is truly great in all aspects - my interest in the technical side of things, the way each area of a show's production influences it and to what degree, has continued to rise over the years.<br />
Still, Code Geass is something that baffles me in this regard. I really can't pin down what makes me love it. But I will try.<br />
<br />
Firstly, high production values. The animation quality is high, and very consistent. CLAMP's art is bonkers but very distinct, and characters/locations are instantly memorable. Fight scenes are well animated. I can't note anything that hinders it in this regard.<br />
Geass has a very strong soundtrack. It is diverse, but focused, and perfectly complements the bursts of fabulousness with celebratory trumpets and upbeat drums and spanish guitars (yep). On the other end of the spectrum are the tracks by Hitomi; beautiful melancholic minimal songs. The soundtrack has so many memorable themes; quite an achievement when far too many shows lean heavily on one theme in particular. The dynamic soundtrack works wonders, driven primarily by trumpets and a female choir. Roughly 50 different songs per season. Yeah.<br />
Additionally: an ensemble cast of voice actors. All bring extraordinary colour to their characters (EXTRA colour in addition to the distinctive 'each character gets a unique hair colour' thing). All memorable performances. Charles played by Wakamoto. The incredibly versatile Sakurai Takahiro as the eternally troubled Suzaku. Inoue Norihiro perfectly restrained as Schneizel. Minami Omi brings a perfect naive defiance to Euphemia.<br />
But the standout is of course Fukuyama Jun as Lelouch. Never has a voice been so weirdly deep. But he parallels this with his normal voice as Lelouch being Lelouch, rather than Zero. He gets so into character, you can feel the desperation growing throughout R2, especially when he screams out Nunally's name. He perfectly encapsulates all sides of Lelouch. Just amazing.<br />
<br />
And that brings me to what I kind of figure to be the show's strongest aspect: Lelouch. He holds everything together. One of the most compelling characters I have seen. Yes, he is overpowered, but the real draw of Lelouch is his emotions. He is flawed. Nunally is his flaw, and it's when she becomes an important part of the plot that Lelouch's true colours show, and it is delicious. He is a wounded man, SO deeply wounded in so many ways. It is ridiculous, but ridiculously entertaining to watch him balance his emotions with his intelligence. <br />
His relationship with Suzaku is so frustrating (because Suzaku is so frustrating AND frustrated), but again, very compelling. Constantly Lelouch's main hindrance, but Lelouch's best friend. Oh god is it a perfect coincidence, but it is so very entertaining. And then, the moment when Lelouch emerges as emperor with Suzaku as his loyal knight. Holy shit, the most perfectly ridiculously satisfying thing ever.<br />
<br />
The entire cast of characters is very strong. It is one of the largest casts ever, yet each character is distinct. Most are shallow, yes, but somehow...all are distinct. They all feel like characters. I think it's because every character has a motivation. Every character besides the main bunch IS basically a motivation. The all have something driving them into action in some way, and when they all intersect it is a bloodbath of emotion. Constantly. The main themes are loyalty and betrayal, and the characters perfectly encapsulate this. <br />
<br />
The ending is again ridiculous but the entire show's emotional peak. It is perfect.<br />
<br />
I think I kind of stopped explaining myself properly there, and I've glossed over a lot....but I find it hard to talk about this show in objective terms, because Code Geass is for me an emotion-based experience. I think people who say it is bad are glossing over a lot of things though. There is a lot of creative talent behind this show (most of which stems from Taniguchi Goro...I believe), and in terms of presentation, there are few shows that can match this.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

i'm well aware of that. i'm not talking about the actual content in this case, i'm talking about how he directs, and specifically the stark contrast between Planetes and Geass. Planetes could very easily have turned out bad in the hands of someone else.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

I can totally see where you and she are coming from. I know I am biased myself, since part of the reason why I can't accept Code Geass for the over-the-top nonsense that it could be (like TTGL, great comparison Litrydow gave) is because of all the fans that take it seriously as you said. From what I've heard of Valvrave, danz makes a good point as well. I've also read a post that claimed that the only people who can enjoy chuuni stories are those who actually take them seriously (like the general Code Geass fandom) and those who can sit back and enjoy the potentially unintentional over-the-top dialogue without being embarrassed.<br />
<br />
Also a note about the voice acting. Wakamoto sounded like he was parodying himself (as he often does these days). Fukuyama was in tune with the plot, totally chuuni. I found it funny at times.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

Plot holes and absurdity in Code Geass are a given. To point them out is to miss the point entirely.<!--quote--></div>If you agree with the thought that Code Geass is unintentionally camp (the best kind of camp, according to the article), then I don't think there is a "point" to miss. There are failings, which one can enjoy or dislike. <br />
<br />
The currently airing adaptation of Jojo has many camp scenes, here's one of them off the top of my head- Jonathan Joestar says "Have you ever looked at the bottom of your neck? All Joestars have a star birthmark on it!!" to which his daughter and grandson respond with utter and hilarious bewilderment. The shock scene lies on the completely unlikely premise that the characters really never looked at their naked back in a mirror, which is hilarious- and the plot never stops taking the statement seriously which gives the campy feeling, while keeping full control over the work. On the other hand, Code Geass has moments like the one when you wonder what trick the writers will use to save all the Japanese, and you get the whole cosplay thing, an answer that's a mix of cringeworthy and funny, that the story itself -doesn't- take seriously seriously (the Britannian officials don't buy into the silly trick) but it makes it work by having Suzaku convince Britannia to let them go. As far as camp goes, I find Jojo's a lot better than Code Geass' which I mainly see as terrible writing.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

To think about it any more than needed is to do yourself a great disservice. Yeah there are plot holes, yeah there are inconsistencies in character development, yeah the show's logic is just plain stupid, but if you can bring yourself to just not care about it, the show is just a pure adrenaline thrill ride.<!--quote--></div><br />
I agree with this. The show is retarded as hell but I did have fun with it, I just can't consider it <em>good</em> because it takes itself seriously.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><!--link--><a href="http://myanimelist.net/clubs.php?cid=35120"><img class="userimg" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/MkmghXm.jpg" /></a></div></td>

I can totally see where you and she are coming from. I know I am biased myself, since part of the reason why I can't accept Code Geass for the over-the-top nonsense that it could be (like TTGL, great comparison Litrydow gave) is because of all the fans that take it seriously as you said. From what I've heard of Valvrave, danz makes a good point as well. I've also read a post that claimed that the only people who can enjoy chuuni stories are those who actually take them seriously (like the general Code Geass fandom) and those who can sit back and enjoy the potentially unintentional over-the-top dialogue without being embarrassed.<br />
<br />
Also a note about the voice acting. Wakamoto sounded like he was parodying himself (as he often does these days). Fukuyama was in tune with the plot, totally chuuni. I found it funny at times.<!--quote--></div><br />
uh oh i think i've dug myself a hole. I didn't mean that I take it as a great comedy. I take it seriously, and get completely caught up in the drama and find myself emotionally attached. Admittedly when there is a really ridiculous plot twist I can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it, but ultimately yes, I take it seriously.<br />
I guess in this sense I'm not too different from the masses who love it. <br />
The point I was trying to make (I think) was that the approach of 'let's pack it with ridiculous plot twists and forego logic in favour of just about everything else' actually works in its favour. What I understand a lot of the arguments against Geass to be are that its creators didn't realize that what they were creating was riddled with holes and leaps in logic - I think they (particularly Taniguchi) intended on this approach. That despite the absurdity of Geass' events, there was always a strong focus on where things were headed. I remember reading some dude's post somewhere about Geass and he basically countered a lot of arguments against the show that detailed plot holes. He rebuked a bunch of the plot holes. The guy had watched the show like 7 times. After completing Geass for the third time, I wasn't at a loss. Everything was a lot clearer the third time round, and whereas with previous viewings I had felt like there were definitely things that didn't add up, the third time round a lot of those things made sense. I wish I could pinpoint examples, but I'd need to watch it all again to refresh my memory...so I guess I have no credibility.<br />
<br />
Look, I don't know where I'm going with this. Basically I'm trying to justify why I enjoy it so much, why it affects me so.... because I don't think it's bad. I think it's well-made. Its pacing is relentless, intoxicating. I just can't imagine not getting caught up in it, the same way people who don't like it probably can't imagine getting caught up in it. It's a weird one. <br />
<br />
People compare it Valvrave. I think Valvrave is terrible. I think Code Geass is great. I think the difference is characters. Code Geass has Lelouch, a fantastic anti-hero, as well as the rest of the cast who are mostly shallow but very distinct; Valvrave has instantly unlikable leads and forgettable side characters (i only watched two eps of Valvrave admittedly). I think there is definitely something about Code Geass that makes it good. It is not a bad show, and one day I will blow you all away with why this is so.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

But I can see where you both are coming from. Also, I think my calling Code Geass "very bad" was a little inaccurate because I think the first season, while having slightly over-the-top dialogue and characters, doesn't have that many absurd twists until the later episodes. I can't say the same of R2, though.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message30301327">I think the first two short comments on the show reflect greatly what Code Geass is. It's an entry-level anime that gives it's audience all the explosive tropes with little bars held. Episode one's shock value doesn't fade as the series progresses - it's a level maintained throughout the series. People have become embarrassed to like Code Geass. While it's easy to get caught up in the bombastic dialogue and narrative turns, Code Geass is incredible. Code Geass is a production that could only exist in the medium of anime because it draws heavily on so many anime influences and structures.<br />
<br />
It's Legend of the Galactic Heroes for teenagers and while it's existence may be unnecessary, it has done great things for the medium of anime and has created a gateway into the currently stunted medium letting people who don't like anime know "anime is okay." No matter how you cut it up, Code Geass has made an enormous impact on anime and therefore should be celebrated.<br />
<br />
Obviously Code Geass is with it's flaws - most glaringly it's ridiculous twists... but they're a double-edged sword. Without them the anime would fade into obscurity like Valvrave. Code Geass is a show that constantly writes itself into a corner to beg the viewer, "you think we can't get out of this?" The plot is not about will Lelouch win, it's how. Critic's think themselves incredible when pointing out plot holes in action series. Code Geass wasn't meant to be believable or realistic. Code Geass is self-aware, and truly a show of it's own breed. It's a charming and unique anime.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><!--link--><a href="http://myanimelist.net/animelist/Detective&amp;sclick=1"><img class="userimg" data-src="http://cdn.myanimelist.net/signature/Detective.png" /></a> </div></td>

Code Geass was a blast. I've seen a boatload of anime since then and my opinion of it hasn't changed. It's one of the most fun anime I've had the pleasure of experiencing. I saw it while in high school with my brother and we still talk about from time to time and usually end with "Man, what an entertaining show." I do remember taking the show seriously and I was excited to see what would happen next. I wasn't making fun of it because it was bad. The drama really got me fired up. The ending of both series had me at the edge of my seat. My brother and I said stuff like, "Ohhhhh man, did you see what just happened!?!?!?! That was insane." "Lelouch is such a massive jerk but I love em'!" "Why does Ashford Academy have a slut team!?" It was a wild ride.<br />

What's the big deal with being embarrassed at liking Code Geass (or any series for that matter)? Are you not sophisticated if you like something such as this? Is it like saying you don't want to run around in the rain because that's what immature kids do? Are you too adult to enjoy chocolate chip cookies and milk. Hmmmmm!?!?
