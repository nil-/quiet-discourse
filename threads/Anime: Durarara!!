Fortunately Durarara has its own unique identity not just with its modern setting but also a more methodically assembled plot.<br />
<br />
Durararas principle allure is appealingly presenting current day Ikebukuro and Japanese youth culture. interacting with their diverse collection of social contacts The series recognizes the important role that internet chat rooms, online associations, cell phones, and text messaging in teenagers social lives. Durarara integrates teen pop culture elements at all its seams without calling inappropriate attention to that aspect or stealing focus away from its main plot.<br />
<br />
The second great appeal of Durarara is its diverse and colorful mix of personalities. Through their adventures around Ikebukuro, we meet many colorful and instantly memorable characters However not all of the characters get as much attention as they might seem to all too often a new and exciting character would be introduced to great fanfare but makes there presence felt for only an episode or two before their out of the picture. the second half of the series shifts focus from telling the story from the perspective of the teen leads to being a story about them which is unfortunate since they are the least charismatic of the bunch. which is unfortunate for the real stars as they become background characters as the series progresses.<br />
<br />
The plotting is where the root of the problems lie It starts better than well enough after a first episode introducing the smattering of wild personalities it quickly sets into telling a number of parallel supernatural mysteries that initially appear oblique to each other but are intertwined. The early storylines build characters and situations that are more than they seem and layer genuinely surprising revelations and twists with misdirection all which constantly keeps the viewer guessing yet when expectations are heightened the series likes to pull back lower the tension and play off climaxes, theres a definite feeling of underutilized potential and unfinished business at the end.<br />
<br />
Durarara suits its colorful style and outlandish story best. the final set of episodes bogs down in teen angst that wasted the momentum the series had built up to that point. Overall though Durarara is still a great watch, hip, original, engaging, and vastly entertaining.<br />

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message31607465">The first half of Durarara!! is pretty addicting urban legend suspense stuff. It intimidates at first by having such a large cast, but each and every one of the characters is cool in a modern, hip way and also not at all complex, making them both easy to digest and to quickly like. This works in its favor for the most part, because Ikebukuro is not only the setting for Durarara!!, it is also essentially also the story and the main character. So, the story presents the city to you in pieces; those components are the cast, whose stories mingle, collide, and combine in an interesting and gripping fashion. <br />
<br />
The way show even opens up with this exact premise in mind. The first character we are introduced to (Mikado) is the new kid in town - he knows next to nothing about the city, so he spends the episode learning about it. Who does the teaching? Well, none other than an old friend of his (Kida), who has definitely been changed significantly by living here. In fact, that's how we are introduced to him - not by who he is, but how he definitely isn't the same after living in Ikebukuro. And the episode goes on like that,  moving from set piece to set piece really characterizing nothing except for the city itself. Even when Izaya is taunting Kamichika as she contemplates suicide, the strongest imagery given in the entire episode is the blood stain on the ground - a permanent fixture of Ikebukuro, forever marking more pieces of the wide and untold story of the town.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Durarara!!'s most satisfying moment is also the point where it drops the ball and seems to lose its grasp on what made it special and fun. That point being, of course, the plot twist in the very middle of the show which I won't spoil here. This reveal is executed near perfectly and feels as good as it should considering every episode before it was straight build-up without many if any real chances for the viewer to feel the weight of suspense lifted even for a moment. However, the sense of mystery and mystique is abandoned in the second half, starting with another immediate reveal that should have and could have been built up properly (without taking up 12 episodes again) so that it was satisfying instead of just placed on the table unceremoniously, and followed up by the audience suddenly being allowed to hear Celty speak. It's like the show forgot its very essence after the one reveal and gave up on hiding anything anymore. To be fair, many things after the half-way point could be figured out or assumed pretty easily, but that doesn't excuse the laziness in keeping the tone of the show intact.<br />
<br />
Luckily, Durarara!! still has its sense of style and mildly amusing though one dimensional cast to make it not too difficult a feat to make the second half of the show a fun, very &quot;anime&quot; romp, but the aftertaste is bitter.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig">&quot;My tables-meet it is I set it down<br />

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message31640291">I just found Durarara!! to be a disappointment all around. It had everything it needed to be a favourite of mine: great visuals, a cool and modern soundtrack, larger than life characters who had potential for great development, several intertwining storylines and most importantly the writer for Baccano!, arguably one of the greatest anime in existence.<br />
<br />
Then I watched episode 1... (spoilers ahead)<br />
<div class="spoiler"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.nextSibling.nextSibling.style.display='block';this.style.display='none';" value="Show spoiler"> <span class="spoiler_content" style="display:none"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.parentNode.style.display='none';this.parentNode.parentNode.childNodes[0].style.display='block';" value="Hide spoiler"><br><br />
Okay, episode 1 shouldn't always be the most exciting, but nothing happened. The setting was cool, and the characters were eccentric enough to keep me watching. They alluded to powerful guys that would show up sometime in the future and that was probably the hook.<br />
<br />
Then we finally got to see some of these cool characters. The headless rider, Shizuo who had a huge temper and equally large strength, Izaya who was cold and calculative. So how do we mess up the show from here? Shizuo and Izaya are basically on the back burner for the entirety of the show. The headless rider Celty becomes the most boring character (yet still eccentric) character in the series. I just didn't care for her missing head because her interactions with every character was just so boring and her angst, while justified, just didn't fit with the headless rider persona. Yeah, you've personified an urban myth, but in so doing, you've made her a boring teenager.<br />
<br />
Speaking of boring teenagers, our main 3. There's just nothing interesting about them. They're all your typical teenagers with something special about them. You've got your shy glasses girl, your shy and wimpy main dude and his happy go luck best friend. Yeah they're leaders of 3 warring factions, but it's the factions themselves, their history and the actions they undertake that are interesting and not the leaders. In theory, it's pretty exciting that 3 best friends (stuck in a love triangle even!) don't even know that they're enemies, but when put into full swing in Durarara!!, it just didn't work. It's hard to say why, but I suspect is has something to do with the writer pulling his punches; instead of resolving things the way it was built up to resolve (ie. probably a few deaths and destruction of the city), we get a resolution which I can't even remember because it just wasn't interesting.<br />
<br />
In the end, we're back to where we started. What was the point of everything? The city is back to where it started. The characters are back to where they started bar a bit of development. Celty, the character with the most potential is the most boring character in the show.<br />
<br />
The only reason for my continuation of watching the show was the expectation of something interesting or exciting to happen. It didn't. At least with Baccano!, even when the not so interesting things were happening, the pace was so fast, or the characters were interesting enough that we could get through it no problem. Unfortunately Durarara!! suffers from having no plot to work with so the pace is much too leisurely. It gets boring fast because it decides to focus on the wrong characters.<br />
<br />
That said, it's ridiculousness and sense of style are more than enough reason to keep watching the show. I mightn't have enjoyed it, but I can see why others would. People wouldn't mind the leisurely pace or the boring characters simply because the setting is cool enough to fill that void. It isn't enough for me, but that's just me. Let's hope season 2 will rectify these problems. I'm hopeful it will, we're talking about the guy who wrote the brilliant Baccano! after all.<br />

It has this wonderful way of implying something amazing and terrifying and yet almost plausible without explicitly stating it.  All of the evidence is on the table, and you're left to draw one conclusion from it.  And then the show pulls back on the reigns, laughs, and slaps you in the back with a &quot;no way, man!  You didn't think we were actually going there, did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Episode 12.5 (the first of the DVD special episodes) opens with a startling revelation.  A UFO sighted in Ikebukuro!  An invasion has begun!  What madness is this?  And with a voice over from the otaku gang, we discover that this is &quot;the day that fantasy became reality.&quot;  And then we backpedal a few hours, and in the 20 minutes of screentime that follow, we learn exactly how it came to be that these UFOs were sighted over Ikebukuro.  When we finally see how this happened (in a way that is still quite crazy, but perfectly in keeping with the constraints of the Durarara universe that has been established to this point), it is in many ways the fulfillment of a promise.  &quot;We'll show you exactly how this thing came to be.  But the answer may not be exactly what you expect.&quot;<br />
<br />
The main series executes this in a big way, by emitting a slow drip of information which gradually implies that Mika got decapitated and then had Celty's head surgically attached. Of course, the anime never actually tells us this.  It presents us with a series of facts, allows us to form our incorrect conclusion, and then laughs at us and gives us the real answer, the answer which fits the facts of the story and seems inevitable despite the fact that it is surprising.  I think that is the very definition of a &quot;twist&quot; executed well.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, this is something that Baccano played with a lot due to its anachronic nature.  (Durarara doesn't do it nearly as much due to being mostly chronological in nature, but it does get a few good punches in.)  One specific example from the Baccano discussion thread:<br />

My favorite example of this is the scene in the train with Clair and one of the Russo gang members. Early on, we see Clair confront a Russo gang member in the rear car of the train and get held up at gunpoint. Later, Jacuzzi stumbles upon the aftermath of that confrontation, seeing a collapsed bloody body in a conductor's uniform that has sustained a gunshot wound to the head. The audience logically concludes from this that our friend Clair has met an untimely demise.<br />
<br />
It's not until episode 9 that we see the what really happened in between those two moments in time, and how the altercation between Clair and the gang member resulted in the bloody mess later discovered by Jacuzzi. The episode begins by showing us the same sequence of events we saw before: Clair confronts the gang member, and is held up at gunpoint. The audience braces for the moment we've all been waiting for, the moment when Clair is shot and becomes the bloody corpse that Jacuzzi stumbles upon. But this moment never comes. Clair is able to disarm his assailant and turn the tables on him, killing him with a gunshot to the head. And in that moment, we come to a real understanding of what Jacuzzi saw: it was the corpse of the Russo gang member that Clair killed. This is a complete subversion of our expectations: as it turns out, Clair is not the victim, but the killer.<br />
<br />
That sequence strikes me as bloody brilliant.<!--quote--></div><br />

After the revelation about Mika's head (haha of course Mika didn't get decapitated how could you possibly think otherwise), we're presented with several other twists.  Anri is Saika!  Kida is the leader of the Yellow Scarfs!  Mikado has his personal army!  And yet it's pretty uniformly agreed that the show goes south after we get into the habit of seeing every episode introduced by Rookiez is Punk'd (not that I have anything against the band).  I would contend that the reason that the twists in the latter half of the show don't work well is that they fail to properly deliver on the &quot;surprising yet inevitable&quot; factor that is required for a proper twist.  The show doesn't attempt to mislead you by implying answers that are different from the real reveal.  So when we get to the reveal, either you saw the writing on the wall and came to the correct conclusion about what the twist would be (in which case it doesn't feel surprising), or you missed the hints and got completely blindsided (in which case it doesn't feel inevitable).  The critical element that is missing here is <em>misdirection</em>.  In order to have a twist, you can't just have an information vacuum.  That's just a simple mystery.  There needs to be something that leads us along the wrong path and making us believe that we know what is coming while at the same time pointing toward a different real explanation that we smack ourselves for not having seen coming.<br />
<br />
Turning back to the Baccano example above, the reason the twist works is because it is a reversal of our expectations.  If the audience has <em>no</em> expectations, the &quot;twist&quot; doesn't work.  There needs to be incomplete information that allows the audience to form an incorrect picture of what happened, and <em>that</em> is the point at which the anime can deliver its big reveal.<!--spoiler--></span></div></div><div class="postActions"></div></td>
