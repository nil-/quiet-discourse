		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message27786975">Kino's Journey is a failure of a show in every respect. The biggest problems with it lie in its very foundation: each and every one of its conflicts are entirely too brief to say anything substantial, and the few things it <em>does</em> say are completely one-sided. These issues are compounded by weak characters, even weaker production values, and the entire gosh-darned structure of the show being more flawed than Prinny's <!--link--><a href="http://pastebin.com/RgKZVYV8" rel="nofollow">napkin defense</a> (like, super flawed, in other words). <br />
<br />
Kino's Journey builds each of its episodes out of the same age-old "what if..." questions we know quite well from sci-fi. The problem is that Kino does not give enough attention to ANY of these questions. The potentially interesting subject of what labor really means, for example, is entirely glossed over simply because the show's format does not allow it to go any further than that. Kino's Journey has a tendency to bite off more than it can chew. Attempting to examine the essence of an extremely broad subject like communication in a mere 20 minutes is almost insulting. These subject require time to breath, to examine different perspectives, to witness them in a more well-rounded and unhurried capacity. Kino's Journey instead opts to be nothing more than a hastily cobbled together and cripplingly insubstantial Cliff's Notes on various schools of thoughts. <br />
<br />
It isn't even a matter of it presenting questions for the audience to mull over after the episode is through. No, it answers its own questions, and it does so in the most fallacious, disingenuous way possible. While Kino is a neutral to a fault "character", the show itself clearly has a stake in one side of each conflict. Having a marked perspective in a work is hardly an inherent flaw, but the show stoops to being blatantly reductionistic to the other side of the conflict to make its point. Take the first episode, ostensibly a commentary on the ins and outs of communication: what it actually amounts to is a paltry piece of propaganda. Largely inoffensive propaganda, but propaganda nonetheless. What we're shows is technology being some sort of catalyst for everyone effectively being able to hear each other's id. This leads to <em>everyone</em> voluntarily becoming isolated. This is a crass overgeneralization at best. I mean, this entire club is dedicated to ideas that conflict those in this episode. Technology does not turn us into animals, operating entirely on instinct. But Kino's Journey stealthily ignores any ideas that don't jive with its own, and the end result feels intellectually dishonest at every turn. It wants you to believe in <em>its</em> ideals, <em>its</em> philosophies, and it will stoop as low as necessary to ensure this.<br />
<div class="spoiler"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.nextSibling.nextSibling.style.display='block';this.style.display='none';" value="Show spoiler"> <span class="spoiler_content" style="display:none"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.parentNode.style.display='none';this.parentNode.parentNode.childNodes[0].style.display='block';" value="Hide spoiler"><br>It's worth noting that I agree with many of the sentiments parted in Kino's Journey, but that is besides the point. The way it presents them is still extremely problematic.<!--spoiler--></span></div><br />
Also problematic is the entire structure of the show! Dissecting societal issues in the way it does ignores the way that different facets of society coalesce. Communication can not be examined in a bubble. Everything around it shapes it, as does the converse. These ideas would be better served integrated more naturally into a better-realized setting (a la GitS SAC). Of course, removing these ideas from their shallow parable-istic (totes not a word) formula would reveal their unflattering bits falling apart at the seams. And we can't have that now, can we?<br />
<br />
Nearly everyone Kino meets along her journey is a laughably one-dimensional caricature of whatever idea they represent. The only exception I can think of to this is the girl who is trying to build a plane, but this is only bright point when looked at aside the show's plethora of dead bulbs. Even she is an underdeveloped and idealized character, but at least there's some life to her, something almost <em>human</em> that makes her tick. As for the main characters, Hermes is a dimwitted motorcycle with the perpetual intonation of a child begging his mother to take him to the bathroom. His sole purpose is to give Kino a jumping-off point for her pseudo-philisophical musings, if you could even call them hers; Kino is an empty-slated author mouthpiece of the worst kind. Hiding under the thin veneer of vague nothings that dribble out of her mouth is, well, nothing. It could be argued that she is simply a medium, a means of conveying the journey, which is a fair enough point and one that I can agree with. However, when the journey is as bad as it is, the end result is only recursive shit.<br />
<br />
Production values are fatally stilted and obscured by dreadful scan lines. The animation is incredibly stiff in ways that inhibits one's ability to become properly immersed in what little atmosphere the show might have to offer. Pivotal dramatic scenes are rendered hilarious at the hands of this lusterless production, such as the scene where the adult traveler in episode 4 just kind of lumbers himself into a motionless knife. This problem poisons the well and just about every moment in Kino's Journey is worse off for it. Character interactions, the feeble backbone of how the show extolls its half-assed morals/"philosophies", are always inhumanly stiff and difficult to take seriously, completing the perfect picture of a really, really bad show.<br />
<br />
The narrative force of this show is nil (not nil- (nor nilf!)). As stand-alone stories, as a "philosophical" musing, even as a mere audio-visual <em>thing</em>; it is an abject failure of a show, no matter how you spin it.</div><div style="margin-top: 8px;"><em>Modified by RMNDolphy, 01-24-14, 2:58 PM</em></div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><div style="text-align: right;"><!--link--><a href="http://drillmilkyholmes.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7ALjX4f.png" /></a></div></td>

I assume everyone knows what makes the anime good so here are a few things which imo make it a little bad (or more than a little):<br />
<br />
This is the demonstration of episode 1: 'if you and all of your acquaintances acquired telepathy in far-fetched circumstances, you would become isolated. Telepathy is undesirable'.<br />
<br />
This has many problems. First, there is no point in demonstrating that: even if people acquired telepathy, it's false that everyone in the country would; it's false that it would be so untested, and irreversible. Second, a country with a science so developed as to make telepathy possible should have telecommunications, rendering the episode pointless. There are phonographs in this episode, which were invented at around the same time as telephones. (I won't mention the motorcycle considering the extreme variety of technological landscapes we see during Kino's journey)<br />
<br />
Another part I remember is the half-episode about democracy. as I remember it, people were voting for what laws they wanted and ended up voting for the execution of political opponents, which resulted in the slaughter of the entire country... now I do believe that in many respects democracy is the tyranny of the majority, but the way the anime shows it is an utter strawman. It depicts a dysfunctional simplistic society that has no chance of existing. The author bends politics and human nature for his purposes and that is a poor way to make a point.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message28020617">You are both taking the stories way too literally. Dolphy has it right in calling them parables - comparisons, analogies. The characters aren't very well developed entirely purposefully, because that is not the focus of the show. Pointing out the problems the show has in practical ways is like calling super robot shows for there being no plausible way for those robots to exist. Missing the forest for the trees.<br />
<br />
Of course, it has been a metric forever since I watched this show, so I can hardly remember any details, but criticizing something for not having something it never really intended to have (plausible world building in this case) isn't a good way to look at things.<br />
<br />
p.s. I completely agree about the visuals (pretty shitty)</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig">&quot;My tables-meet it is I set it down<br />

<br />
I basically view Kino no Tabi as an awful looking educational tool. True to parable form, the stories in KnT abstract away from everything other than the bare necessities required to model specific characteristics of humanity. Since these models are so simple, running simulations using them and drawing conclusions from them is straightforward. That's all well and good, so long as the viewer actually finds those exercises useful. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't. For educational purposes, I prefer models that are somewhat less divorced from reality. KnT is uninteresting. And hideous.

<br />
Of course, it has been a metric forever since I watched this show, so I can hardly remember any details, but criticizing something for not having something it never really intended to have (plausible world building in this case) isn't a good way to look at things.<br />

Being a parable excuses nothing. An author choosing a poor format for their subject matter is not something the audience should have to actively make amends for. The responsibility is on the creators to find the best way to convey what they are trying to say. The issues presented in Kino's Journey are far more grave, broad, and deserving of serious attention; Parables are one of the worst way to get those points across as their scope is invariably limited by this format. No need to repeat points I've already made though. I've already described <em>why</em> I think these topics are done a disservice by this structure.<br />

However, I rewatched the series up to episode 5, and as far as parables go, episode 0, 2, 3 and 4 were pretty good. <br />
<br />
In episode 0, the citizens of the country build a meaningless tower. This is the key scene for me: "Kino: Why does everyone in this country build the tower? <br />
Countryman: Why, you ask... who knows? I only know how to stack bricks, so..."<br />
For me, the episode is a pretty strong case against state-supported enterprise, showing fairly consistently that allowing people to continue their job just because they don't know anything else (i.e. would be jobless) results in a waste of resources and meaningless labour. Government subsidies to the Japanese whaling industry make fishermen hunt meat that is never bought and rots, making a pointless work like this episode's characters. Human nature is not bent for the author's purposes. There's a point, and it's well made. The democracy episode had a point, but it was poorly made, and the telepathy episode didn't have a valid point to begin with.<br />
<br />
The first part of episode 3 is also interesting... it shows people believing that the world will end because of a prophecy, and quite funny, losing their money because of it (offering free goods and services to Kino). During the last few years there's been several major similar predictions, with many people getting scammed and reasons to believe similar to those exposed in the episode. I'd say the episode does prey on an easy human flaw, but it does it well.<br />

Many things have value in simplicity, but only if it is beneficial to the subject. <br />
<br />
Parables are not necessarily without worth. They can often serve as a sort of mnemonic  to help kids learn valuable life lessons. They give a memorable little story to attach to concepts that the older folk would very much like them to abide by. When we get older though, the world as we see it becomes far more complex and imperfect and no longer fits into the neat bow of a silly little parable. The relatively inconsequential issue with parables becomes exponentially more problematic when Kino's Journey tries to tackle massive, complex subjects in a mere 20 minutes. So, while I do think parables are kind of a silly thing to carry into adulthood, my larger problem is that they just aren't suited to the topics presented in Kino's Journey at all.<br />
<br />
lpf's examples are actually good examples of this! Sure, they have some basis in reality - you can tie them to real events that've happened, actual things one might believe in<strong><span style="color:crimson">*<!--color--></span></strong> - but this doesn't ameliorate the fact that the way these points are being presented is ultimately very limited in scope and overly simplified in the same vein as most parables. The whaling example, in the grand scheme of things, is extremely minute. Most state-supported enterprises, although not without their minor shortcomings, run themselves fairly well. If they didn't, the world would be in far deeper shit than it is now. The public generally only catches wind of the negatives though - the stuff we hear on the news. After all, there's no reason to report that something is simply working as it should. This is bound to create a fairly skewed perception of the subject, and that skewed perception is the foundation of this episode. This is the flaw of tying complex issues into silly little parables, and Kino's Journey is rife with this stuff.<br />

In fact, I felt it was a solid introduction to the series because it signifies the importance of a flawed world (the big primary moral of Kino). More specifically, it gives insight on the necessity for secrecy and deception coming from flawed communication. By letting everyone in on everyone else's thoughts, secrets are no longer possible. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Instrumentality has been achieved.<!--strike--></span> Conflicts arise because without the ability to prevent thoughts from spilling out, people quickly become spiteful of each other and society as a whole starts to collapse.<br />
<br />
Sure, if you get into plot holes, they're rampant, but Kino is purposefully done in hypotheticals and thus without a need to answer how events are set up. In other words, if one is concerned with "why did everyone get the treatment simultaneously?", you may as well be asking why there's an isolated town in the middle of nowhere with its own civilization, or how they even speak the same tongue as Kino or even wear similar clothes. Or how telepathy was invented! Point is, these "plot holes" are insignificant, like asking how Flash can run at super sonic speed and not instantly kill himself when he runs into a wall, when, you know, you're not even asking how he can freakin' run at super sonic speed in the first place.<br />
<br />
There is also the simplicity aspect in its story by clearly sticking to it message through and through without providing complexity from other willful routes. Unlike a few others here, I find this well-suited primarily because simplicity works well for simple and/or broad messages. Contrary to Dolphy's belief that the subject matter is "more grave" and thus "deserving of special attention", I don't think they're much more grave at all (episode one, for example, as stated above). Neither do I take episode 0 as literal as a criticism of government subsidies, but more broadly as pointing out waste and inefficency in organization.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><div style="text-align: center;"><!--link--><a href="http://myanimelist.net/clubs.php?cid=40791">QD</a><!--center--></div></div></td>

I'm getting tired of adventure town nonsense like Kino, where I'm given a narrative and supposed to take something from it. Like Dolphy, I didn't. All I took back was that Kino wasn't as great as I first thought, and that's what I get for not paying attention.

<br />
The intro is merely just a thesis, I'm assuming, so I can't really have anything to get out of in terms constructive criticism.<br />
<br />
Your assumption that Kino's biggest problem stems from the fact that it doesn't bother to give any attention to the pondering philosophical question that it presents to you. In what we can conceive to be just a lazy way of the writers is really the opposite of the intention of how Kino's Journey's way of progressing it's themes and putting it into the narrative. The questions that are given to each episode aren't really answered, simply because they are questions that don't have an objective/concrete answer to them whatsoever. That's what makes the show's way of dissecting these themes smart in the sense that the title "Journey" can be construed as how every single human being goes through these sorts of questions that they ponder about that ultimately leads to doubt their very notion of looking for the answers in the first place. Simply because the answers are so abstract and so beyond our comprehension that we may never find the answer throughout our lives. This is, in a sense, why the show succeeds in portraying the philosophical themes that are present in that they don't really give the audience any leverage on what the answers are, they just put it on the plateau of the narrative and let the audience themselves put the pieces together and figure out themselves how these questions should be taken at face-value. It's not technically brilliant to say that we should try to explain every nook and cranny of the questions because that would severely damage the pacing of the story, which is very minimal to begin with in Kino.<br />
<br />
<div class="quotetext">While Kino is a neutral to a fault "character", the show itself clearly has a stake in one side of each conflict. Having a marked perspective in a work is hardly an inherent flaw, but the show stoops to being blatantly reductionistic to the other side of the conflict to make its point.<!--quote--></div>So you're saying that the show is bad because it has a message that it wants to portray and wants to make it seem like it's the right one? For one, it would make the show garbled in this mishmash of different ideals that make the show's intended message really confusing and not well-developed at all (*cough*Evangelion*cough*). All authors of fiction that have a basis for their arguments within the themes of the stories have this inclination of portraying the opposite viewpoint as wrong, yet no one else seems to say those stories are bad because of this fact. You can't expect Kino's "propaganda", as you call it, to not have a all-around basis on every single argument because that would make it's own ideal point to be weak and not as profound. From that point-of-view your argument makes it sound like you're critiquing an opinionated article than an actual show; even you're criticisms of the show having an overgeneralized way of telling it's own message are the same way of how you criticize Kino's Journey in not putting into account how others see it and having a clear blatant agenda in them.<br />
<br />
I do agree partly in that the world of Kino's Journey isn't very well explained or realized in giving us a clear way of how it's structured, but you have to understand the type of narrative it follows. Since it's "Kino's Journey," we're mostly looking at the world from Kino's point-of-view in a 1st person structure, not in a large 3rd-person narrative. She's journeying a world that she has no inclination on how it is governed or how the people live throughout their daily lives. Saying that something like GitS: SAC succeeds in this type of setting doesn't really hold water in that they are both completely different structured shows; Kino's Journey follows one character and her only, while GitS follows a whole group of people and sometimes individual in some plot arcs.<br />
<br />
I understand where you come from how all of the other characters feel very one-dimensional besides our two main leads. But when you really look at the big picture, I don't think it's even necessary to not make them one-dimensional in the first place. Don't you think Kino and Hermes are the only characters that should even be bothered with development when they're the ones we're always following in the first place? Granted, Mushishi does indeed do the opposite in trying to incorporate more development in every plot arc besides Ginko, but for Kino it's a lot more grandeur in its scope and how minimal it's story is in the first place. Your criticisms on Hermes is a bit blatant and fallacious so I'm not going to bother trying to argue that point. Kino herself is really what makes the show for what it is and while you tend to focus too much on how she spews out philosophical musings, which really isn't all what she is to begin with. Her strong spirit in venturing off into this journey that she decides to go on and her strong development from how she was brought up in her childhood make her more than this empty philosophical mouthpiece that you claim that that's all she is.<br />

This whole critique of how bad the production is can't be taken seriously considering how there are a lot of shows that have suffered through this sort of thing yet no one else seems to be bothered by it (LoGH, Evangelion, etc.). It's an ultimately subjective statement in saying the art is bad when it's just a different style of animation that's really no different from what most shows looked like in its time. It's not a very sexy show to look at but then again, it's not a high budget shounen show to begin with.</div><div style="margin-top: 8px;"><em>Modified by Gonzo-nyan, 01-28-14, 1:22 PM</em></div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><div style="text-align: center;"><!--link--><a href="http://gonzonyan.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"><img class="userimg" data-src="http://i.minus.com/iFBKqTvDcfeI1.png" /></a><!--center--></div></div></td>

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message28056617">Ok, I'm here to provide an alternate viewpoint. I'll get it out of the way - I love Kino's Journey. Dolphy's post raises some great points, but I feel like they don't affect me because I approach the show differently. So I'm not going to deny that he's flat out wrong, because I guess he isn't (and besides, philosophically my knowledge is pretty slim in comparison to his it seems).<br />
<br />
I love Kino's Journey because of the world in which it is set, and the concept behind it. The idea of a traveler and her motorcycle travelling a strange world between 'countries' that each have their own way of life, their own flaws and their own unique perspective.<br />
And the show's visual design makes the very different countries co-inhabit this world seamlessly. You have little village countries and then a megalopolis, yet there's a consistency throughout the show in how each country is presented.<br />
Understandably the art style isn't everyone's cup of tea. The scan lines are initially off-putting and can remain so. But for me they supported the show's unique and memorable visual presentation, along with the washed-out colors and the way the sky and trees and land were drawn.<br />
For me there are just so many memorable images. The men working on the train track in the middle of nowhere, the underwater city, the huge landscapes between countries, the holes filled with corpses in that rock/desert place, the massive tower (though that's from the Tower Country special).<br />
<br />
Obviously the focus seems to primarily be the subtext of each country and situation. It's pretty damn hard to miss it. But I feel the way it points things out yet never truly resolves any issues is interesting. It's more food for thought than seriously addressing the societal problems. It doesn't provide solutions, but it points out flaws in certain ways of thinking and demonstrates potential consequences. I don't think they are meant to be truly reflective of us and our world. They are exaggerations on purpose. The countries are ways of artistically representing these musings. They are countries based almost entirely around a single idea, and seeing that realized visually is what I love.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>
