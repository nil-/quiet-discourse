		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message27963165">For those not familiar with the series, Maria-sama is a character study set in a Japanese Catholic school for girls where etiquette and tradition are at the center of everything. It is an unusual backdrop in anime to say the least, especially due to the amalgamation of Western and Eastern culture: the character portrayals are Japanese at heart, but pervaded by Christian values. Reflecting this in particular are the <em>Souer</em> relationships, which compose the core motif of the story. In essence, it revolves around the concept of bonding people through a relationship of mutual understanding and support, where a senior student (referred as 'sister') guides an underclassman (referred as 'little sister') both in and outside of the classroom. As the previous descriptions suggest, the bonds are of a sisterly nature; they delineate a strong sense of intimacy, and this is reflected in the character interactions in a truly beautiful manner. The appeal of such bonds is not limited to how they are conveyed though; witnessing them slowly being threaded is also wonderful, much thanks to the delicate pacing and subtle character building. In this sense, Maria-sama's slow paced approach is similar to Saraiya Goyou's, particularly the way it develops backgrounds for the characters and their relationships through gradually integrated backstories. A few of them are poorly structured and might come out as melodramatic, unfortunately. But all in all, they do an excellent job at laying out and strengthening the cast's interpersonal dynamics; the particularities they reveal are also of great importance in understanding the characters' motivations. Of course, there is a lot of flair added to the mix—particularly the yuri undertones—but thanks to how things are paced and presented, they are anything but obtrusive and actually feel like an ingrained part of the relationships: something that naturally happened over time. This is how yuri should be done: subtly and as something that is defined by the relationship and not the inverse. <br />
<br />
One important thing to note is that while the drama is often triggered by silly misunderstandings, the characters always manage to resolve their differences through dialogue and mutual understanding; here the solid foundations upon which the relationships are built become evident. The resolutions are rarely complex, but behind their simplicity they carry a lot of subtle meaning. <br />
<br />
Maria-sama 3rd retains much of the charm and character of the previous seasons, but there are a couple important differences that should be noted. First of all, the drama is largely toned down and the episodes are even more slice of life oriented; we are still presented with the same characters, but in a more everyday context. The change of tone is undeniably positive, and even without the intricate character drama of the second season, the writing remains as strong as ever. One of the things that make this season successful is the wide array of scenarios and situations never explored in the series before. What most shines under these circumstances is the dynamics between the characters—they are at a point of their relationship where they truly understand each other (as if they are together in their own world), so watching them interact in a different context in their own unique way is fascinating to say the least. Much of this is goes hand in hand with the character growth carried on from the previous seasons, with the characters reacting to situations and environments in manners that would be inconceivable in the past—the development is strongly cumulative. <br />
<br />
Second, this season has evidently superior production values than its prequels. While Maria-sama isn't the kind of anime that requires particularly fluid movement, the inconsistent animation would occasionally hinder the effectiveness of the characters' body language and give an awkward impression. Thankfully, the third season has great character animation, doing a fairly better job at conveying the emotional state of the characters. Art direction, too, is very solid, doing a particularly commendable job in regards to scenery (the Venezia episode was on par with Origination when it comes to scenery pr0n and atmosphere building). The music, on the other hand, while not particularly improved, remains as graceful as ever. And more importantly, it remains in tone with how the show depicts school life, creating a soundscape of classical instrumentation that is perfectly befitting of the elegance and serenity that so deeply permeates the Lillian Girls' Academy.  <br />
<br />
In conclusion, this anime is goddamn good. Go watch it now!!!<br />

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message28003981">Parial did an excellent job at providing an overview to the Maria-sama ga Miteru franchise, so my post will focus on the third season (which is arguably the best installment in my view) along with some background information on the two leading ladies. <br />
<br />
The first thing to note about MariMite 3rd is that it's almost entirely centered on the show's primary soeur pair, Yumi and Sachiko. Although the other sisters are still prominent figures in every episode (Yoshino &lt;3), they sort of take a backseat as most of the external events relate to the development of Yumi and Sachiko's relationship. And speaking of their relationship, what a beautifully complex one they have at that. On one end, you have Yumi, who is about as average as girls her age come (though don't bother asking me how to measure averageness in a 15-year old Japanese Catholic girl). Whereas on the other, you have Sachiko - who is a prim, elegant and astonishingly beautiful young lady from a wealthy household - basically, the polar opposite of Yumi. Through a series of unexpected conveniences, but ultimately a heartfelt connection, Yumi ends up becoming Sachiko's soeur - an event she could have never dreamed of, even in, well, her wildest dreams. <br />
<br />
As one might expect, a relationship between two girls from two completely different backgrounds would be anything but peaches and roses - perhaps an assorted mixture of sweet and spicy chocolates would make for a better metaphor. Within a fairly short span of time, the formality of their sisterly ritual begins to wear thin as Yumi doubts her worth as Sachiko's soeur - leading to some brief bouts of avoidance, miscommunication and temporary rifts between the two. But with pain comes understanding, and it is only through this that the two are able to become more intimate as a result. You see, although Yumi and Sachiko are complete opposites on a surface level, they both share a common flaw as emotional human beings - that they keep a lot of their feelings bottled up, and do not initially rely on the support of each other to sort out their issues. <br />
<br />
As the seasons change from spring to summer, a gentle breeze signals a period of warmth and relaxation. But beyond that, it is a precious time for Yumi and Sachiko to bond, to reconcile, and above all, to enjoy life together. <br />
<br />
The major differences between MariMite 3rd and the previous installments are the length of each episode (clocking in at 50 minutes, as opposed to the standard 24), and the slight change in tone from the dramatic to the natural. As a result, this provides proper exposure to the pair's relationship, carefully detailing their daily activities and most intimate conversations instead of simply skipping ahead to the episode's conflict. That's not to say the OVA is free from the occasional silly drama (some of which is unfortunately a bit unnecessary), but in general the smooth pacing and gradual build up irons out any jarring mood shifts that its predecessors had. Likewise, by adopting a more down to earth approach, the OVA places greater emphasis on the characters' more subtle nuances, taking great care to convey them as realistically as possible. For instance, a scene where Sachiko vents her frustration caused by some snobby socialites is made all the more convincing by the amount of detail in her body language. Her ire is conveyed exceptionally well by the crossness of her facial expression, the tenseness of her posture and the anger in her tone of voice (on a side note, Miki Itou's performance is completely spot-on for Sachiko's character type). As Yumi approaches her and attempts to lend a helping hand, you can see Sachiko's initial reluctance as she maintains distance and averts her gaze - a defensive mechanism used to shut herself off from others, and easily the cause of many of her interpersonal problems. However, after Yumi continues to interject, you can slowly see the change in Sachiko's demeanor, as she relaxes and opens herself up to Yumi, and to communication. It's a powerful display of the pair's trust, and it's the combined effect of similar memorable scenes that gives the OVA a very understated, beautiful quality.<br />
<br />
And if we want to get really technical with definitions of "beautiful", MariMite 3rd boasts some very high quality production values (something that may be a bit uncharacteristic of Studio DEEN). Gone are the days of animation inconsistencies, as the OVA maintains an incredibly polished look throughout - picturesque backgrounds and fluid character movements a plenty. The general art direction is also handled well, with special attention given to the lighting, framing and especially some of the <!--link--><a href="http://i.imgur.com/iLUvgZD.jpg" rel="nofollow">scene layouts</a>. The soundtrack also deserves a special mention, for its evocative classical-infused score and solid timing of pieces to suit the quaint and serene atmosphere. <br />
<br />
Above all, MariMite 3rd thoroughly explores the cast in a meaningful way, placing it above many other character-driven works. Sachiko, who initially comes across as cold, strict and aloof is shown to be a much more caring and vulnerable person than her princess image would suggest. As a result, not only does she become a more likable character, but we can now understand the rationale behind many of her previous actions. Likewise, Yumi's time spent with her older sister has a very pronounced effect on her overall being (though the method in which the anime portrays these changes is quite subtle). Most of the idol worship she had for Sachiko is now gone, as she no longer views her as being on a higher plane, but rather someone she can actively trust and confide in. Being separated still causes her some anxiety (in the last episode), but she is able to work through this with the help of her other friends and ultimately emerge as a more independent young woman.  <br />
<br />
Overall, Maria-sama ga Miteru 3rd (and by extension, the entire series) is a beautiful display of character intimacy, along with one of the most complex and well-realized casts in any anime. The series now has a special place in my heart for most of the reasons I've listed above, and I'd highly recommend it to people that appreciate series with realistic characters and mild inklings of shoujo-ai that are never overbearing.<br />
