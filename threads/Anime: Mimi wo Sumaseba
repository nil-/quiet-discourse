Adolescence is among the most memorable phases in one's life. During this time, we tend to make decisions based on adrenaline instincts, work as we wish to, while repudiating any advice. Some of us even develop endearing feelings of love for someone, while also chasing our own dream or even remoulding them for the sake of someone else, often out of inspiration and seldom out of desperation.<br />
<br />
Working on the themes of adolescence and infatuation giving rise to a wonderful journey of self discovery, Studio Ghibli presents us with Mimi wo Sumaseba also commonly known as Whisper of the Heart. The story mainly revolves around the female lead, Shizuku Tsukishima, a junior high school girl living in New Tama Town. The story progresses as Shizuku constantly finds a certain someone, named Seiji Awasama, always issuing books before she does at her town library, which leads her to grow a sense of respect while her imagination weaves together a personality of Seiji as one could only describe as the "Prince Charming of her life." Much to her disappointment, Seiji is any thing but the "prince charming" she had imagined him to be; but Seiji had a unique charm of his own. One thing led to another and soon, Shizuku starts facing typical teenage life problem ranging from the urge to rebel against her parent's wishes, unnecessarily squabbling with her siblings, while also realising she has fallen in love with "not-the-prince-charming-she-had-imagined", Seiji. Hereby follows a movie about self discovery, presented in the most heartwarming way possible.<br />
<br />
Now it may seem like any other teenage-romance on pen and paper, but Whisper of the Heart, has its own charm, specially due to the way it presents itself. The problem with most romance shows now a days is that they tend to be extremely dull or overly melodramatic and their predictable plot structure doesn’t help them much either. While being melodramatic, most also tend to be highly unrealistic with their character interactions, their behaviour, body language and much more which just brings their over all quality down. Whisper of the heart, throws all these out of the window and carves its path through this genre in a rather realistic and dramatic way, without crossing the dreaded line between the dramatic and the melodramatic. Character interactions are seamless and seem as realistic as it can get for a story of such sorts. Characters behave as a mere reflection of any other ordinary teenager, as they would to the shown circumstances and these strokes of realism are even more integrated into the movie with the help of detailed, subtle body language of the the characters through which many emotions are shown, rather than told through mere dialogue exchange.<br />
<br />
The characters themselves are rather eccentric even though they are fairly ordinary people. The female lead, Shizuka, is a rather charming and adorable girl. Her relation with her family and her friends is well portrayed through meaningful dialogue. Her monologues of what she thinks about her sister, mother, her best friends and her general view of the situations she faces helps build up her base character along with her relationship with the side characters in a gradual and methodical way. The development that Shizuka goes through the movie, simply put, is phenomenal. From a naive junior high student, who didn’t know what she wanted to do with her talent, and on the bigger scale, with her life; Shizuka realises her field of interest and recognises her talents. Her love for writing also explores her vivid and colourful imagination. She comes to realise the importance of family and meeting up with family expectations, while chasing her individual dream too, but the main motivation behind most of her development is her love interest, Seiji.<br />
<br />
Seiji is quite the character himself. He is shown as an ordinary boy, working at his grandfather’s small antique shop, while learning both, to build and play the violin. The development between Seiji and Shizuko’s romantic relationship, albeit a bit cheesy, was handled with great care. While Seiji doesn’t receive as much development as Shizuko on screen, most of his character development is rather implied. While maintaining Seiji’s lively manner, we see a sense of responsibility grow in him which we naturally see in most teens as they go through their phase of adolescence. His growth in sense of responsibility is established through his interactions with Shizuko, specially, the conversation they have on the school rooftop where they realise they have to work their way so that they could live and spend more time together in the future.All these character interactions which lead to their subtle development, was neatly woven together by the skilful hands of the director, Yoshifumi Kondou, who is known for his works in various other critically acclaimed works such as Omoide Poroporo and Akage no Anne as an animation director.<br />
<br />
Studio Ghibli has always been known for sending the audience into another magical dimension with their various works, but sometimes, due to the lack of proper direction, the whole magical element backfires, and in the end, the movie tends to become a mess. Thankfully, Whisper of the Heart, is not one of these movies! Even though the movie is highly realistic at its core, Studio Ghibli didn’t stop from adding their key fantasy elements into the movie. And with the efficient direction, these were used to enhance the whole experience of the viewer. Shizuka’s main writing work is dynamically shown, rather than being simply narrated. These scenes range from talking rabbits wearing monocles to riding an air stream to an unknown mysterious castle. All these fantasy elements are integrated into the movie with great caress without leaving deep scars on the strokes of realism, the movie portrays.<br />
<br />
The animation delivered by Studio Ghibli, as usual, is fantastic. Great detail is maintained in almost every frame and the movement of characters and the general motion is as fluid as it can get. The landscape scenes are pretty eye candy and the movie is completely devoid of any ugly CGI. There are some great camera angles used when necessary, sometime to show the overarching city while some soothing music plays to evoke a strange feeling of nostalgia. The artistic direction of the movie takes credits when the fantasy world is involved, as the colour palette becomes much more vibrant and animation becomes subtly smoother and camera angles range from the typical to experimental ones where Shizuka is shown riding the winds to the castle.<br />
<br />
Along with the magical animation, the movie imbues a deep sense of nostalgia with its musical direction. The movie begins with Olivia Newton John’s cover of the famous song, Country Road, which itself evokes a warm fuzzy feeling in the viewer, making them feel right at home. Other than that particular cover of John Dever’s, country road, a japanese rendition is sung many times in the movie and their placement couldn’t have been more correct which added to the overall atmosphere of the film, whenever they were used. A personal favourite would be when Seiji plays the violin and Shizuka sings along and the elders join in with various other instruments, to create one of the most joyous and heart warming scenes in anime for me personally, but one could feel free to disagree, I guess. Other soundtracks just add to the magic of the film and its overarching, heartwarming atmosphere. To weave such a fantastic atmosphere, and evoke feelings of nostalgia with the music alone, credits must be given to the “music director”, Yuuiji Nomi who is also known for his quirky OST’s in Nichijou.<br />
<br />
With all that said and done, I must conclude by saying that Whisper of the Heart is a wonderful coming of age film; and a journey of self discovery. This film has something for everybody to enjoy, whether it be seeing yourself as a teenager grow up in the movie, facing similar problems or for parents, who could see how to co-operate with their child when they’re in their rebellious phase of life and let them freely chase their dreams. The fantastic musical score coupled with the fluid animation has the right balance of drama imbibed into it. It may appear to some as a typical animated work at first glance but once the experience is over, many will quickly realise that Whisper of the Heart is anything but typical.<br />

We often praise Ghibli for their talent in animating stuff, but this scene is the one in which their talent is truly put to use. The scene slowly builds the climax, using the three old men's arrival to boost the scene, starting with the tambourine only, then introducing more instruments as the scene goes. Adding to the climax is Shizuku opening up with body language more and more dynamic, all animated with a realism on par with the very best of the medium. <!--link--><a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3encn_si-tu-tends-l-oreille-country-road_fun" rel="nofollow">Here's the scene, so you can check that for yourself. :)</a></div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

Even if one might not be able to relate to any of the somewhat corny characters (which I doubt), they still feel genuinely human. The tale of the Baron and Baroness augments the movie in a magical and heart-felt way without take away from its down to earth nature. Another lovely aspect of this movie is the relationships between people of different generations; their interactions are subtle but overflowing with emotions. It displays a profound and inexplicable quality shared by all human beings (please someone help me put this quality into words). <br />
<br />
The singing scene is indeed wonderful. It's one of my favorite scenes in any anime, not least because I love Country Roads. <br />
<br />
My complaints may be mute to all the connoisseurs here, but I think this movie is a bit <em>too</em> corny. There's only so much you can do with such a simple premise; Ghibli did that and then some more. They did a great job at spicing up the story with their signature magic, and even then it was still too cheesy and predictable. The kids' love troubles in the first half of the movie felt especially unnecessary. Overall, Mimi wo Sumaseba is an wonderful and satisfying, but somewhat corny, experience.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

<br />
<em>Mimi wo Sumaseba</em> begins with a song. "Take Me Home, Country Roads" bustles by as the camera pans over traffic and worn homes, capturing routine activities in the western Tokyo surburbs. The film regards 20th century adolescence, but it is also more encompassing than that; it depicts life in all its mediocrity, treasuring the banal acts that come to define us.<br />
<br />
The details in the incidental may be what first distinguishes <em>Mimi wo Sumaseba</em>, but there are also surprising corners it takes to cover new ground. Just as in the classic shoujo plot, junior high schooler Shizuku and her friend Yuko experience chaste romance for the first time. However, the film also confronts craftsmanship and the dream to create something truly wonderful. Indeed, there is even something breathing life in every shot: the everyday commute, the trip for milk to the groceries, the aged history behind antiques, the trivial conversations with family members.<br />
<br />
The film is gorgeous, which is perhaps an unsurprising achievement given the studio. Cinematography, lighting, artwork, color palette—every craft feels worn and soulful. What may be surprising is that it is directed by neither of the main duo (Miyazaki and Takahata) but by Yoshifumi Kondo, whose only previous experience has been in animation and character design.<br />
<br />
<em>Mimi wo Sumaseba</em> is essentially Kondo's one masterpiece. It was released as his directorial debut while with the expectation that he was to be Studio Ghibli's successor, only to pass away three years later. The film is loosely adapted from a manga by Aoi Hiiragi, a coarse story with the fundamental concepts but roughly executed. Kondo took the work and effectively polished it to be the final product that it is now. The characters are less shoujo caricatures, Seiji is now a violin maker instead of a painter, and the overall story better comprehemends the pursuit of the artist and removes the complications in the manga's romance. This, as well as the elegant production that Kondo accomplishes, grants the film its own identity.<br />
<br />
Love is a difficult emotion to express well, yet <em>Mimi wo Sumaseba</em> delivers head-and-shoulders above all else. While Shizuku does not willingly look for romance, hanging out with her friends and several boys makes her well aware of it. This slowly grows into an idealization of a dreamy, refined Seiji Amazawa, in fashion to the fairy tales she's disposed to reading. In true and true shoujo form, it backfires in the cutest ways. Being teased by the real Seiji for eating a "big lunch", and seeing Shizuku's irritated look, simply feels genuine. The entirety of their actions around each other is strikingly accurate, given off by the charm of the mood and their subdued mannerisms. The voice acting is almost too cute. It's also amusing simply to watch the reactions etched on Shizuku's face.<br />
<br />
The flow of the story is as seamless as it can be. It's lackadaiscal, but tightly wound up enough to hold a definitive structure. The various threads of the story all converge just about one-third of the way in, now focusing on Shizuku's entrance into a new world as she finds herself in a small antique shop, and bumping into Seiji along the way. Moon, the fat and possibly sentient cat, is one of many elements of magical realism in the film—also a handy assistant to lead the story to wherever it need be. The Baron as well is almost his own character, with large lustered eyes and livening up a room by purely existing. It's a wonderful blend of untold depth and etherealness that brings <em>Mimi wo Sumaseba</em> onto a higher plane; we can experience a unparalleled degree of affection that is virtually impossible to realize otherwise.<br />
<br />
Music has a large presence in the story, oftentimes serving as a driving force to accentuate the reccurent themes. Just as the opening song comes and goes, Shizuku directly references the hit, concoting her own version "Concrete Roads" simply for the fun. Who would expect it to spark Seiji and Shizuku's first playful fight, only to then becoming a running occurrence? There is also the heartfelt scene placed stark in the center of the film—Seiji playing the violin, Shizuku singing the lyrics, and three <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">wise<!--strike--></span> old men dawdling in to compose an ad hoc performance. The singing is occasionally flat, and the ensemble is rough and choppy, but this is what makes it so charming. There is so much emotion dug into Shizuku's voice acting and the instruments, that the scene in its entirety feels almost otherworldly.<br />
<br />
Indecision with the future happens to everyone, and Shizuku eventually seeks to find a dream that she can pursue. This sudden motivation is brought on by love of course, but it doesn't stifle the lone idea from carrying emotion for every viewer. Her later struggles in writing a story is summed up accurately by the old shopkeeper: Shizuku is but a rough unpolished stone. As with adolescence in general, the greatest potential lies there in waiting, and she must take her time in order to reach it. (This analogy almost reminds me of a trivia comparison—Hiiragi's manga as the stone, and Kondo's film as the uncovered gem.)<br />
<br />
<em>Mimi wo Sumaseba</em> captures life in its rough and tumbling form. There is no artificiality present throughout the film, nor any contrived preparation to weaken the impact of Shizuku and Seiji's resolve. The result leaves viewers spellbound. Whether it be the artisanry, the romance, the fantasy, or simply the pursuit toward a dream, there is something in <em>Mimi wo Sumaseba</em> for everybody to learn and cherish.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><div style="text-align: center;"><!--link--><a href="http://myanimelist.net/clubs.php?cid=40791">QD</a><!--center--></div></div></td>
