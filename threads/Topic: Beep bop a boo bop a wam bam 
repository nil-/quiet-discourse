Is art (AND ANIME I GUESS), first and foremost, a form or personal expression or something made with concessions for the audience? Should people dilute what they're trying to express for the sake of reaching the audience, or should they try to bring their vision to life in the purest form possible and accept that it will only resonate with a smaller audience? This obviously applies more for abstract-leaning works and the like, but even rather straightforward works do this sort of thing.

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message31389555">A cool thing about art is its malleability in interpretation. Feel free to speculate on subject of the Mona Lisa, wonder if the infinite mirrors in Citizen Kane represent Charles' emptiness, and question if a cigar is just a cigar. But storytelling usually isn't riddled with riddles, and I'd guess most screenwriters and directors just focus on telling their story without loading the gun to the point of unwieldy.<br />
<br />
And that's how I want storytelling. Tell a story. A show or film that's all about a theme or message with no connection to the story is hollow (Ghost in the Shell comes to mind). It's like the screenwriter or director is too focused on pushing a message, to the point where the characters are a side-effect. To paraphrase Gareth Edwards, &quot;you should never start a story going <em>I'm going to make a movie about this theme</em>, but after a while you sort of discover what the film is about. This hidden thing that rises to the surface and says <em>this is what I'm really about.</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
I watch anime, or any film, because I'm expecting a story. I don't want storytelling integrity lost because the characters are nothing but vehicles for themes. Screenwriters and directors should make that concession to the audience keeping in mind it's entertainment first and foremost. It's for other people to watch, and they just have to hope enough people like it to give them incentive to go on; that's prolly part of why some genres are more niche than others. And that brings me to another angle I'm taking from the topic.<br />
<br />
When dealing with certain (any?) genres there's prolly some incentive to either focus on making the story work for what it is or try and reach out to a general audience. Once in a while we get something that forgoes the trade-off like The Dark Knight, but otherwise they lean toward one or the other. I'm cool with something for a general audience like J.J. Abrams Star Trek, and also enjoy some of the older Star Trek films the general audience has no patience for.<br />
<br />
So yah, I've got no problem with who their target audience is so long as the work itself is at least decent. This goes back to how the screenwriter or director should focus on storytelling instead of art or theme or whatever. The underlying message will appear if it's there, but sometimes, the director or screenwriter should just write a story about a traumatized pilot or magical girls suffering simply because they're sadistic bastards.<br />

<br />
Anyways, no I don't really think the audience should be considered too much. I'm not one to really enjoy an anime that completely panders to its fans (except when it panders to someone like me, and even then I guess it's shameless that I'd go along with it). I mean pandering to a group more or less kills any creativity and just gives the people what they want. I dunno, I feel like if it's an idea that's been done before, it should really be avoided in a creative process. i.e. Madoka Magica, even though I'm not the biggest fan of it, never pandered in the original series and it felt like it really didn't care too much about its fans. However, In the newest film, Rebellion, there was a good bit of shameless pandering thrown in to seemingly please hardcore fans I'd guess. Kind of just giving them what they'd want and the shock they would expect. This might be appealing to others, but it's not really something I like to see in anime. <br />
<br />
So, I personally think there's something wrong in an anime that aims at appealing a distinct group right out of the gate. This can be said for most anime, but it should be more along the lines of portraying a certain story and letting something like the demographic follow suit. Even if an anime isn't made for a certain person, the themes and messages of a story can relate to the viewer. i.e. picking up the messages from a story and picking out how they apply to you as a viewer, pretty much how it makes you <em>feel</em>. I guess an example of this would be Angel's Egg, an experience I feel that's really melded towards the viewer. I like this because the anime can sort of hold its own experience for the viewer, something nobody else but they experienced while watching it. I dunno, this might be only something viewers like me would delude themselves into thinking, but I really do think that a personal experience towards an anime is important. I feel that this is rather difficult when and anime is boom boom shoot the gun video games and boobz. <br />

<br />
What do you think of the argument that writers shouldn't make something that they don't 'love' and that fewer people will love so that more people 'like' it?<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
As for my own opinion:<br />
<br />
When artists choose to do things their way and choose to speak to fewer people, I think it can lead to great things; however, although speaking to a more limited number of people has the potential to do great things, it doesn't mean it necessarily does just because it's more exclusive. <br />
<br />
Further, when a story restricts his audience, I don't think said audience's opinion is necessarily more valid or invalid than the rest of the crowd. IMO the opinion on Lucky Star of the person who's watched Haruhi is neither more valid than the newbie who didn't get the references. For examples, watchers missing the 'exclusive' content have be left with a flawed story the exclusivers overlooked but that the others can't be blamed for picking up on. I've talked with people for whom Ano Hana had an emotional value because they knew and liked the ED song from long before, with that cover of Secret Base being made ten years after its first release in accordance with the lyrics and the story being an homage to the song, and I while that's a move I have a lot of respect for, I found the story itself pretty bad. Worse, I think that actually trying to carry out the homage might have contributed to damaging the story in having Menma come back specifically ten years after her death for no real reason. <br />
<br />
The same thing goes for things like <!--link--><a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/23213/Kantoku_Fuyuki_Todoki">Kantoku Fuyuki Todoki</a>, which I enjoy far less/differently than those who're old enough to connect with the references. On the other hand, the Daicon openings' authenticy speaks to me in a somewhat personal way that I accept fully that will not matter to others. The same thing applies for references to literature, philosophy or religion. Evangelion might use Bible references, but does our knowledge of the Bible makes us righter than Japanese viewers who don't know about it? Plus, some of those who know the Bible might disagree among themselves about whether they're used cleverly or not -- again, just because part of the content is more restricted doesn't mean it's necessarily great, so defending content by simply saying that it was written with passion and authenticity is not a sufficient argument and you'd still have to explain what precisely about the exclusive content is great. If a big big modern-day otaku wrote his ideal of a story (e.g. <!--link--><a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online">on a fanfiction website</a>), with a harem and everything else, that does not make the opinion of people like us invalid by default. Nisio wrote exactly what he wanted to see in Nisemonogatari; it may not be pandering, but I still didn't like it.<br />
<br />
And, you know, I think that a lot of exclusive content can be inclusive without diluting your intent. Being exclusive is, in this regard, pretentious. A work that makes a lot of literature and philosophical references (imo in a good way but that's not the point), is SubaHibi, and it's very inclusive and unpretentious. It doesn't expect the viewer to know every single reference, and explains a lot of the philosophical parallels with specific authors and basics. It doesn't distract from the quality or dilutes the author's meaning; if anything, it enhances it. Remove all the explanations, and you're left with a bunch of characters who and speak in bad riddles and try hard to be cool. In other words, you'd be left with what I've seen from Kara no Kyoukai (basically just episode 1): inconsequential babble. Subarashiki Hibi and Kara no Kyoukai might both actually use philosophy references really intelligently for all we know, but when they're told like in the latter it's likely you won't be able to appreciate it anyway.</div><div style="margin-top: 8px;"><em>Modified by lpf, 06-06-14, 8:01 PM</em></div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message31495703">I believe that this talk by Jonathan Blow is relevant to this discussion, specifically the first 15 minutes or so where he talks about TV shows: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxFzf6yIfcc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxFzf6yIfcc</a><br />
<br />
To summarize Blow's main talking points, early television shows were designed with several constraints.  The first of these was the &quot;commercial break:&quot; because television shows had interstitial advertisements, they had to have a cliffhanger at around the halfway mark to compel the audience to not change the channel during the few minutes that commercials were shown.  Another (perhaps more limiting) constraint was the fact that you couldn't assume a perfectly regular audience.  The lack of consumer recording technology meant that if someone missed an episode, there was no way for them to &quot;catch up&quot; after a missed episode until the reruns ran months later.  It wasn't until the 1980's that VCR technology became mainstream.  As such, TV writers could not have &quot;indispensable&quot; episodes.  And as a consequence, all shows were episodic rather than serial in nature.  A heavily story-driven show like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad could not exist in 1970.<br />
<br />
Even shows from the early era of television that I consider &quot;good&quot; are undeniably hampered by these constraints: Star Trek TOS (1966-1969) episodes are incredibly formulaic, with the same dramatic stingers timed in accordance with the placement of commercial breaks.  Because the show is structured so that the episodes can be watched in any order and any episode can be skipped, you know that there is zero risk of any of the main crew members dying (and it is also highly probable that any new character that has just been introduced is at high risk of dying when the writers want to raise the stakes).  To be clear, I don't believe that formulas are inherently bad, and the strength of the Star Trek formula is a large part what made it an enjoyable show, and it's what allowed a show with a large staff of writers to remain thematically consistent for the most part.  For an interesting read, check out this Star Trek Writers Guide: <a href="http://www.bu.edu/clarion/guides/Star_Trek_Writers_Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bu.edu/clarion/guides/Star_Trek_Writers_Guide.pdf</a><br />
<br />
All of this of course applies to anime as well.<br />
<br />
There are some medium constraints that we take for granted.  For example, most anime are made for a TV viewing audience, and as a result they are produced to fit into a 30 minute broadcast time slot, which means 25 airing time including the OP and ED.  OP and ED are 90 seconds long each (a mostly arbitrary convention), so that means 22 minutes are dedicated to the actual episode, with very little flexibility.  But what if the creator wants to create an episode that is not exactly 22 minutes in length?  What if they only have 15 minutes of material, and have to come up with another 7 minutes of filler to pad it out?  Again, this is another place where manga adaptations are frequently at a disadvantage when the creators try to do a strict 1:1 chapter:episode ratio, because frequently it means turning a 10-15 minute read into a 25-minute viewing experience.  Some early shounen anime are notoriously bad about this.<br />
<br />
The time constraint problem can work in the opposite direction as well.  For example, Detective Conan tries to avoid the filler problem by splitting each episode into two 12-minute segments, each covering a single mystery.  But sometimes, the running time isn't long enough to properly encapsulate all the details that were present in the manga.  And for a mystery story like Detective Conan, that's sometimes a problem, because sometimes omitting a small clue can make the story's conclusion seem illogical.<br />
<br />
Further on the subject of timing and television show logistics, episode count is another thing to consider.  TV shows are made to broadcast for a single season, meaning that they typically air in chunks of 12-13 or 24-26 episodes.  But what if the story the anime is trying to tell is better suited to a different episode count?  What if the story has enough content to be told in exactly 15 episodes?  (Bakemonogatari sort of got around this by doing a 12-episode TV broadcast and then airing the last 3 episodes online.)  I also feel that there are a lot of 12-episode anime that might function better if they were shorter; I think we've all seen anime that don't have nearly enough content to justify their episode count.<br />
<br />
There are other cases where audience considerations constrain anime creators, particularly adaptive works.  Anime that are based on manga, light novels, or visual novels frequently must be created to appease the fans of the original work.  In some cases, you have scenes that work well in the light novel medium, but don't translate well to the more visual medium of anime.  For example, non-animated media often have longer expository sequences that are necessary to explain things that can't effectively be conveyed through visuals.  As a result, you have anime that doesn't fully utilize the freedom afforded by its own medium.<br />
<br />
On the subject of manga, I found Bakuman to be a particularly instructive work (in its content, not its presentation) because it describes the manga-making process (or at least how making manga for Shounen Jump works) in a way that makes it very clear how the Shounen Jump &quot;formula&quot; came to be.  Authors, on a week to week basis, must retain the interest of their readership.  And this often guides the direction of their storytelling.  I've noticed that some cases, serialized manga tends to short-circuit the typical storytelling cycle of rising and falling action, because when you're being judged on a weekly basis, there is no time for falling action.  Some established mangaka are able to break free of this to a certain extent, as a long-running series is less likely to be canceled even if there is a lull for a &quot;slow burn,&quot; but that's something that mangaka must earn through reputation (both their own reputation and the reputation of their work).</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

Many people won't understand all that, and will come to dislike the show.  But what makes this show good is the fast, zany, hyper-kinetic pacing.  They can't really slow down, to provide exposition on all the references and symbolism, or it would really hurt the flow and atmosphere.  Certainly, there's references one might miss after a quick watch-through, and it will probably take 2-3 watches (or pausing/rewinding) to get the most of it, but in this case, I feel that their approach is worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Mind Game and Sayonara Zetsubou are two other shows where the pacing/flow/atmosphere would be affected if the creator tried to spoon-feed the audience, instead of being more abstract in some parts.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message31640495">I think what is important with art is not what the artist wants it to say, but rather what the audience gets from the work of art. For example, Bakemonogatari probably says some interesting stuff about life and death, morality and all that other philosophical stuff. Unfortunately, it's presented in a way that does not appeal to me; the otaku pandering route. I therefore am not able to see the way the writer wants me to see, but rather I see just another otaku pandering piece of work.<br />
<br />
This leads to the question I suppose. Should an artist water down their work for the audience to understand? If we go by my example, I would definitely say no. However, the reverse can just as easily work. An anime blogger by the name of E-Minor demonstrates my point perfectly. I hope he doesn't mind this link to his post.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://moesucks.com/2012/07/31/in-defense-of-guilty-crown/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://moesucks.com/2012/07/31/in-defense-of-guilty-crown/</a><br />
<br />
Here he defends Guilty Crown; an anime which is regarded by the majority of non-casual anime fans as one of the most disappointing anime of recent years. While most people see Guilty Crown as a cynical attempt to cash in on big budget action with little regard to plot, E-Minor sees this as a satire (and he defends his point well, I think I've been convinced, but I'll need to rewatch to confirm) which actually has some interesting things to say about the nature of people's tastes in their entertainment.<br />
<br />
So yes, I believe if the artist has a message to convey and wants it to reach a larger audience than it might if it was presented in it's &quot;purest&quot; form, it's not the worst idea in the world. After all, we get stuff like Bakemonogatari and Guilty Crown that are on opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of critical acclaim, yet to me are inverse in the amount of meaning it has. It's presentation might not appeal to everyone, but if it appeals to even one more person than it would have without this &quot;watered down&quot; form, is it not all the more worth it that people get the message? They might not be able to decode the message like me with Monogatari, but it's been sent and regardless of how it's interpreted, getting your work out there is what you want in the end is it not?<br />
<br />
Though then again, I remember watching a the film Free2Play and one of the developers was sad that people couldn't discern the message of his game. So maybe what I wrote is moot, or perhaps it isn't. Perhaps it depends on the artist? Who knows? As long as we keep getting our entertainment with real substance though, I can't complain.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

<div class="quotetext">should they try to bring their vision to life in the purest form possible and accept that it will only resonate with a smaller audience<!--quote--></div><br />
this.<br />
<br />
Of course this can still entail catering to certain audiences. That can simply be a part of your vision (or rather, happen to be. A personal 'vision' does not automatically mean abstract/avant-garde). Or it can be the most abstract thing in the world.<br />
Art is a personal thing, and unless it's entirely a money-minded studio production (see: all LN adaptations and the like), then it will be in one way or another an attempt at someone's vision, or a vision spread across multiple poeple.<br />
<br />
This entire topic immediately makes me think of Aku no Hana - the anime. This is a prime example of someone, in this case Nagahama Hiroshi, following through with HIS vision, knowing full well that it would bomb and be heavily criticised, as he says....<br />
&quot;I knew there was going to be criticism before it aired, because I picked a way to do this anime that people will be critical about. People were saying it looks creepy, but I think it's better to feel something than nothing at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course this same idea applies to pretty much any avant-garde anime. Cat Soup. Mind Game. The works of Yamamura Kouji. End of Evangelion. Mononoke.<br />
Some are more successful than others, but all of them are made, or seem to be made, with only the work itself in mind. And I think they are all in some way a form of personal expression. Of course the degree to which this is so varies heavily (EoE vs Mononoke, for example).</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>
