<br />
Anyhow, my stance on shorter vs. longer works has to do with the execution of the final product in the end. A longer work will usually have the blessing of running time (though this can also be a double-edged sword, depending on production schedules) to develop its characters, settings and themes - however, this does not necessarily mean a longer work has a distinct advantage over a shorter one as there are cases (such as those long running shounens and mahou shoujos) where the lengthy episode counts are not used effectively to further develop story elements, but rather, fill up timeslots. <br />
<br />
On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have things like movies and short films (which I assume is what the topic is partly addressing). Unlike TV shows, plotlines have to be condensed to fit the given format, whether this is a couple hours or a couple minutes. In effect, this places certain restrictions on how creators are able to tell their story, as time is quite literally of the essence. While this may seem like a handicap, a good director and production staff would take a more creative approach, perhaps relying more on visuals or a musical interlude to weave in a narrative. Conversely, a creative staff that fails to do this and bites off more than they can chew before realizing they only have a limited amount of time to conclude their story (see: most noitaminA shows) will encounter difficulties. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, what's important isn't the running time of the work, but rather the production, writing and storytelling. A shorter work is not inherently worse off than a longer one, but a shorter work that contains loose plot threads and a rushed ending is - although this is not an issue of length in this case. In fact, I'd argue that some of the best films and Chinese cartoons are those that achieve a harmonious balance between content and form irrespective of length, but I'll leave that for another discussion.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><div style="text-align: center;"><!--link--><a href="http://moe-alternative.net/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WXb2Rn2.png" /></a><!--center--></div><br />

<br />
While longer run times usually come about by having a popular source material and/or getting a good reception from the first few episodes of the series is a good thing for everyone behind the work-- it doesn't necessarily mean that the work is <em>good</em> to the eye of the critic, which I'm sure everyone in this club somewhat believes they have.<br />
<br />
For example I would consider Hajime no Ippo one of the best sports shounens I've viewed and arguably one of the best of all time, because it is a good anime (not going to elaborate on why as that'd just detract from my point) but something like Bleach for example follows so many of the same overused tropes that all typical battle shounens do. A long air time also leads to problems when adapting a ongoing manga, as most [battle] shounens tend to do, especially having to use filler material. Not always is filler material as unbearable as it is promoted but most of the time not following the plot is quite frustrating, I can't say I've ever enjoyed watching a Bleach filler for example.<br />
<br />
Short running anime have the handicaps such as not being able to truly adapt the source material and also not being able to develop depth, characters and story as sufficiently as wanted, but lengthy anime usually have problems with keeping the viewer interested (especially if it isn't that good of an anime).</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig">"I'd like Kill la Kill,<br />

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message27061249">It depends on the title. What's often called "filler" can sometimes be an effective means of establishing a more meaningful connection between the audience and the characters, simply by way of spending more time with them. Seeing how they behave in a more unhurried context can provide, well, context for how they react to story-happenings. Honestly, the first two example that come to mind for this is Aikatsu, Splash Star, and Azumanga Daioh :) Aria might be a better choice though. All the silly nothings of their everyday life has a pretty incredible cumulative effect by the end. On the other hand though is what people generally mean when speaking of filler, and separating the two usually comes down to a matter of redundancy (or it simply being bad, as is the case with most [demographic redacted]). I guess my point is that the length of a long show can be justified even if it's not constantly progressing the plot in any readily apparent way.<br />
<br />
A larger problem comes when peeps try to adapt stories ill-suited for another medium, and the incessant concessions end up taking a huge toll on the work, but that's an entirely different discussion.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><div style="text-align: right;"><!--link--><a href="http://drillmilkyholmes.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7ALjX4f.png" /></a></div></td>

Not having seen any of those series I can't comment on your reference but I will assume you are right, but when I was speaking of length I was meaning much longer series (typically shounens, especially battle shounens) such as Bleach which has 366 episodes. A few episodes of filler here and there does not bother me, especially when it is just filler to, as you said, "establish[ing] a more meaningful connection between the audience and the characters" but when it comes to longer series having 30 episodes of filler where they introduce things such as characters, storylines, techniques and remove them when the filler(s) are finished and then never acknowledge them again can really detract from the experience.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig">"I'd like Kill la Kill,<br />

Bleach falls under that [demographic redacted] bit that tends to milk things to a detrimental extent. People also have different ideas on what constitutes filler, and many conflate it with anime-original content. I just mean it to describe things that aren't overtly forwarding the plot. That problem you mentioned isn't inherent to lengthy anime and could have been solved with better writing, or by better integrating their original content with the source material. The Card Captor Sakura anime, for example, has a bunch of new content that wasn't in the manga and events play out at a much slower pace. The difference being that care was taken to make sure that all the pieces fit, and the slower pace makes itself an asset rather than a detriment. Stuff like "the big 3" or whatever obviously has some huge problems with pacing and storytelling, but my point is that those aspects, the storytelling and pacing, are squarely to blame, not the length itself. I find the converse problem, not allowing enough room for the story to breathe, is far more prevalent and detrimental overall.<br />

Yes I agree but that is what I'm stating, that lengthy anime can be just as handicapped as shorter anime because, let's say for example the writer isn't horrible like most "Big 3" writers, it is hard to consistently write good content and keep the viewer interested with such a long episode length. I also wouldn't know how hard it would be to meet schedule by adapting source material but I assume that with such high demand for a show such as Bleach or any long running shounen, it'd be hard to not include quite a lot of material in one episode. This then leads to more material in less episodes which then leads to catching up to the source material too fast and voila, boring filler material so they can wait for the source material to slow down.<br />

<br />
Just to pad this out (like a filler episode in a little girl cartoon): Legend of the Galactic Heroes  has 110 episodes and it's like unfunf gimme more (if we don't consider animation) while Monster, a 74 episode show, is absurdly faithful and the animation quality consistent. While the Big Three has a quadrillion episodes, it's not unusual to see Umakoshi and some other cool KAs appear every now and then.<br />
<br />
It's not like short anime doesn't have its problems either. Hourou Musuko/Wandering Son is a noitaminA series and it's ambitious. It starts in medias res (in the manga timeline) and the show is generally pretty. But the animation tends to get shitty at the end and the drama beautifully Okadafied (what is up with the ending???).<br />
<br />
So I think it's a poor correlation -- not a causation -- that length equals quality. I do like long shows but that's because there are many little girl shows that are like that. I'm cool with watching Hotarubi, a really amazing 45 minute film, over some old-ass shounen without qt 3.14 girls.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig">I work in <!--link--><a href="http://vntls.tindabox.net/staff/kastel" rel="nofollow">VNs</a>.

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message27068439">For me, the rule of thumb is: the shorter it is, the fewer plot elements it should have. <br />
And somewhat the opposite for longer works.<br />
<br />
LoGH makes use of its length splendidly. It fleshes out and develops so many characters; not in arcs, but nearly all at once over the course of the series. Thus the cumulative effect happens. It fleshes out an extremely large geography, taking whatever time is needed to craft a multi-faceted conflict on a very large scale with many different geographic/political actors. And hey, look, the plot encompasses so many elements, overlapping way more than enough not to be considered separate arcs, that the writers can foreshadow things and fall on their feet 30 episodes later.<br />
<br />
Now, there are many works that are very long and wouldn't suffer from being shortened by just removing content. While it means they lack the above selling point more complex series have, it doesn't directly cause problems. After all, short works lack it too. And it doesn't mean they can't have other selling points. Examples of works like that include Galaxy Express 999 (imo), Sazae-san, Mushishi manga.<br />
<br />
Opposite to LoGH, shorter anime work best by keeping their focus. Toei's Clannad movie wrote off characters that didn't play a major role in the Nagisa route, for instance. Kyoto Animation's version also prevented secondary characters from taking centre stage, even if they had their route in the VN. I think it's no surprise that many good movies focus on two or three characters, like Whisper of the Heart, Tokyo Godfathers or 5 Centimetres per Second.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, short works implementing too many plot elements / characters may suffer from it and in such cases short length does not excuse lesser impact. The Madoka series <span style="font-size: 80%;">(I can hear liarliar already)<!--size--></span> tried to characterise too many magical girls than it could, resulting in vague allusions to grief and regrets before a character's disappearance, only to remain annoyingly undeveloped. VN adaptations notably suffer from this problem, torn between time obligations and will to follow the source material. The Steins;Gate anime tried to make more of its maid and cross-dresser than mere role characters, but failed remarkably by dedicating only single episodes to each. The Umineko VN well arguably had many spectacular characters (several dozens in total!), but fitting them all in a two-cour anime bred disaster.<br />
<br />
Short stories and longer ones are two different media with different potential. The shortest stories must present storytelling in its barest and purest form, and must relinquish ambitions of depth. Longer stories cannot rely on the gimmicks of short stories but have the potential for more complex explorations of themes or characters. I don't blame stories for lacking what another one has, as there are many ways to be great. What I do ask of fiction is to know what path it chooses and make the best out of it.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

One being Hajime no Ippo as an example of a show that uses its length as a strength - I think it is actually a show that exemplifies a problem long shows have the potential to run into, becoming too similar to themselves. Ippo's fights are incredibly repetitive, which brings down the show as a whole since they take up so much of the show's run time.<br />
<br />
The next is Bleach, which really only has two major filler arcs and both are examples of filler not completely disregarding (and/or being disregarded by) the rest of the plot, with varying success. The protagonists introduced in the Bount arc - the plushies - did not exist at all in the manga but that did not stop the anime from allowing them to become permanent fixtures in the Bleach world. The Zanpakuto arc actually expanded upon ideas introduced but not fully utilized in the manga, as opposed to simply making new things up. They both have continuity problems because Bleach's plot has a very strict timeline so it isn't kind to almost any kind of filler in that way, but they don't really have the problem of mechanics being introduced and tossed away like is claimed.<br />
<br />
My point of view on the "depth" allowed by long shows versus short ones is pretty similar to lpf's. I feel like neither is inherently worse off on a basic concept level. In fact, they pretty much share the exact same list of potential pitfalls that any given story has the potential for. The difference lies only in which pitfalls are more likely to slip through the cracks when not given proper attention by the creators. Short works are more susceptible to shallow characterization when there is a large cast; long works have the same potential problem but have more time to make sure that doesn't happen. Long works are more susceptible to repetition; short works have the same potential problem but are less likely to either become to similar to themselves or be scorned for being repetitive since it doesn't go on as long. And the list continues like that. The issues are the same, but the potential differs.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig">&quot;My tables-meet it is I set it down<br />

- in terms of <strong>character-driven</strong> story, like the above mentioned mahou shoujos anime or any slice of life title, a bigger amount of time spent on the development of every character rarely feels like a waste of time, since it takes a whole lifetime to describe a single individual or fully relate to him/her, minimum. This, of course, in the view that said time isn't spent on repetitive or poorly written contents, because even if those two features are common in the real life (I really hope no one has a poorly written existence tho) in terms of narration they tend to undermine the overall quality of the product;<br />
- in terms of <strong>plot-driven</strong> story I refer to those works that starts with the main purpose of pursuing one or multiple themes. Obviously using characters in doing so, but without the claim to make you feel like they are part of your family or something when the story is over. Major examples of this are short stories or movies, or even some 11-13 episodes long series. The first titles that come to mind in this perspective are Planetes and Journey to the End of the World: the first one in only 4 volumes is able to take multiple views on humanity and various topics about morals and progress, yet it never feels like it's rushed, with plot holes or with poor characters. The latter one is a single volume that may be described as a creepypasta of The Little Prince; you're not even told the protatonist's name, nor you are supposed to know it, it's about the world and the flaws in it and what it tells it's done in a equally well-balanced way as Planetes.<br />
<br />
To present my own antithesis, it's also possible to merge these two points of view and yet be able to create something poignant and enthralling. Major example of this being the manga Blade of the Immortal, where the theme is presented in the third volume or so and never solved (not like you can answer the question "what's right and who's wrong" when you're dealing with a cast of bloody killers) but in 30 volumes there's still both enough development to the characters and not a single hole or standstill in the story.<br />
<br />
There's also the chance that you might be writing a story that needs a lot of time to fully make sense yet you're cut off in the middle due to lack of money/popularity, but that's related more to the industry than the individual ability of the author.<br />

However even if it's short, it can still hit me deep. It's not the length that matters, but the conception and coming to fruition of the entire packaging, and presumably, the pacing, and all that good jazz as well.<br />
<br />
I'd like to concur with what lpf stated, though I do think I personally have more specific terms to define on what basis I would judge the work. For anime,<br />
<br />
a). TV ~40 episodes+: As many has brought up, whether or not there is development, subtle or not, is usually essential to how the work will be judged. Lack of uniqueness and repetitiveness are what will usually ruin a work of this length. <br />
b). TV ~20-30 episodes: This, I find, is the optimal length for high caliber anime. I think this is the cutt-off line for poor productions that can't make the budget for this long of a series in the place, or it simply allows for the right amount of establishing a believable setting and fleshing out the character. Some introductory episodes in the beginning, the meat of the story, then resolve. 2cour and 3cour can both be layered nicely in this length.<br />
c). TV ~11 episodes: Pacing, script, generic characters, etc. are all possibilities. Since most shows have at least enough budget for this many episodes, anything could go wrong. In terms of pacing, a rushed one is problematic but not uncommon.<br />
d). TV ~1, ONA, Special: Don't think much come out of these. Usually just a small supplement for a grander story. Some exceptions are Rain Town and Eve no Jikan, both of which are ONAs, and based on this, these productions are just as prone to judgement as TV~11 episodes. <br />
e). OVAs: Some, such as LotGH, fall under similar convictions as 50+ tv series, while (usually) others are basically just the same thing as specials. <br />
f). Movies: Was a theme(s), purpose, or symbol expanded upon during the movie? Did it have a reasonable sequence of events? Pacing isn't as much of a problem as much as just resolving the issue/story suitably. For instance, action/thrillers should try to end climatically, or something. Movies are judged on much broader criteria often overlapping with cinematographic films in general. <br />
g). Music: Majority are a joke, basically animated version of music videos about mischievous idols. Am I supposed to grade that? <br />
<br />
Manga is done so on a more lax basis since there's only one shots and paneling manga, and I guess doujishi too.. (but I group those with the manga, usually). One could just imagine all the conversations about all the different types of mediums out there: books, visual novels, non-cartoons, etc. <br />
<br />
If one were to eliminate the discrepancies across mediums and just focus on anime, however, I think it's safe to say that having expectations for the length of an anime is fair games. Since the producer/director should both have initial, complete control of how lengthy the work should be and what type of animation they want it release it as, though complicated as it may be by circumstances, it's fair to say that a work was misshaped by the lack or overwhelming amount of time.<br />
<br />
I tend to give higher scores to longer works since, if I don't like a lengthier work, I'll probably drop it earlier. Whereas, in the case of a short anime, it'd be too short of a breeze to pass on. I'd just stick with it for ~12 episodes, even if the anime is atrocious, since it's not as long as, say, 100 episodes of repetitive shounen shenanigans.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

There really shouldn't be any kind of ground rule establishing how long a show can last and automatically assume all of its merits are good or bad based on its length. Depth is the key here, depending on what the show's purpose is, in establishing a worthwhile experience. Many times with shows that go on for over a hundred episodes, such as most shounen shows these days, suffer through tons of filler that fail to garner any kind of semblance to the show's world or are just not entertaining enough to look past the flaw. Sometimes a show that has episodes that only lasts around 3 minutes can still have the potential of being rewarding as long as there's even a little bit depth in its overall nature.</div><div style="margin-top: 8px;"><em>Modified by Gonzo-nyan, 12-23-13, 12:47 PM</em></div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><div style="text-align: center;"><!--link--><a href="http://gonzonyan.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"><img class="userimg" data-src="http://i.minus.com/iFBKqTvDcfeI1.png" /></a><!--center--></div></div></td>
