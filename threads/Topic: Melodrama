Let's begin by dispelling the most common misconception:&quot;Melodramatic&quot; does not mean &quot;sad.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the book, it's defined as &quot;exaggerated and emotional or sentimental; sensational or sensationalized; overdramatic.&quot;  In classic melodrama, each character fills a singular role and is defined by a single emotional state.  This <em>can</em> mean having a character who is always sad and morose, but a character who is always gallant and chivalrous is just as melodramatic as a character who is always melancholy.<br />
<br />
In this way, melodrama is inherently limiting.  Most character arcs are built on contrasting emotional states.  Outside of melodrama, we may see a character who is happy in one scene and morose in another, and by observing the character in different emotional states we learn more about them.  Or maybe we see a cowardly sniveling character evolve into one who is heroic and courageous over the course of the story.  In melodrama, you can't (by definition) do this.  At most, you can have characters explore different points upon a single heroic continuum.  For example, in melodrama, you can't have a character evolve from &quot;cowardly&quot; to &quot;courageous.&quot;  But you can have them evolve from &quot;pretty courageous&quot; to &quot;extremely courageous.&quot;  Melodrama  is incapable of doing many of the things that are constructive in effective storytelling.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there are some strengths inherent to melodrama as well.<br />
<br />
One of the things that we as viewers love is when characters behave &quot;in character.&quot;  When Jonathan Joestar behaves in a manner which is stupid but brave and heroic, we cheer because <em>that's so totally JoJo</em>.  It's in his nature to cast aside logic and be courageous, and as a result it's fairly easy for our expectations to be met.  On the other hand, we do like to see characters evolve; it's rewarding to see a shrinking violet muster up courage and become the hero.  But if this change occurs too rapidly and the changes in their character aren't properly built up, you end up with characters that behave in uncharacteristic manner.<br />
<br />
There are also limitations to character progression.  Having a character with an arc where they overcome a character flaw and become a better person is rewarding when the narrative can be built around this.  But this doesn't work in the context of lengthier narratives.  All long-running shounen series are all incredibly melodramatic (in the sense of having characters that are defined by a single trait and characteristic), and this is to their benefit.  If you have characters that are constantly growing and changing over the course of hundreds of chapters or episodes, it's very easy for them to turn into elastic figures that are constantly being reformed and remade to the point of being unrecognizable.  Characters only have so much room for growth, and if you stretch them beyond that limit it begins to feel unrealistic.  Melodrama is a staple of the shounen jump battle manga for precisely this reason: have every character operate along a single axis, and you never have to worry about them acting &quot;out of character.&quot;  Maybe we get a big character building once every hundred episodes, but on a week-by-week basis, the characters remain mostly the same.<br />
<br />
I think one of the reasons that many people &quot;look down&quot; on melodrama is that we (for the most part) like our characters to be relatable.  We want them to feel like real people.  And real people aren't melodramatic: every person being experiences a full range of human emotion, and that's something that you can't achieve within the context of a melodrama.  But not every story needs to adhere to this.  There's something to be said for larger-than-life characters, like the impossibly clever Jimmy Kudo or the phenomenally heroic Kenshiro.  We don't look at a story like Detective Conan or Fist of the North Star looking for realism.  In large part, the melodrama of their stories is what draws us to them.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message33169305">Kuiper, isn't your definition of meledrama a bit limiting and (forgive me) misleading? Melodrama is by definition exaggerated drama (as you pretty much stated yourself), and while often accompanied by rigid characters, does not inherently entail them. Character development can even effectively be used to create melodrama, so I can't really follow your line of thought.<br />
<br />
I see two main problems with melodrama, the first being the unrealistic events and character behaviors that usually follow it. The storyline is manipulated from its natural progression into one which brings out most emotions in viewers, and characters react in manners so as to further dramatize it. Interesting to note, however, is that most contemporary anime already suffer from these problems. Unlikely events occur all over the place, and exaggerated character behaviors with fittingly warped facial complexions can really be seen as a staple of anime in general. Are (almost) all anime melodramas?<br />
<br />
The second problem is the discrepancy between actual events and their presentation. A certain scene may not be very powerful in itself, but it may be illustrated or scored in overly dramatic ways so as to appear more emotional than it actually is. Tokyo Ghoul is the first example I can think of for this, since it's currently airing. It grabs every opportunity to emphasize just how DARK and VISCERAL its atmosphere is, and ends up cringe worthy as result. Mushishi is opposite to this; while the music and sound is a quintessential component of its experience, it also knows that silence and subtlety is often more powerful than hollow melodrama. <br />
<br />
This leads to a loaded question though: is background music and other similar stylistic elements inherently <em>fake</em>? Is it used because fiction cannot create genuine feelings through writing alone and needs to employ help from other factors which work subconsciously?</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message33174209">So, since I brought the topic up, I feel obliged to say something about this.<br />
<br />
I went with melodrama as a topic because of a currently airing show: Hanayamata. Seeing people call it melodramatic is somewhat of a stark contrast from other shows which are also known for melodrama: the presentation of drama in Hanayamata is different from, say, Anohana. So to answer the first question, I feel like the question of &quot;what's common between the two shows&quot; has to be answered. <br />
<br />
As pointed out by Kuiper and superzarop, melodrama is commonly defined through exaggeration. Both Hanayamata and Anohana have moments where exaggeration is used to give impact to the audience. But beyond that, I don't find anything else in common between them because the exaggeration is used in different ways: I think Anohana's melodrama was a deliberate attempt to make the audience cry, while Hanayamata doesn't really go for a specific emotion; the character drama just happens to be exaggerated because that's how the characters really act in the context of the show. (I hope that made sense)<br />
<br />
Therefore, my stand is that the effect of melodrama depends on how it's used. Melodrama is just one of many storytelling tools, and there's many different ways to use the character exaggeration brought about by using it.<br />

This question doesn't work when discussing a medium as dynamic as anime, or even film. Anime and film do not solely rely on its script or its storyboard to tell a story. Unlike books, where you just have the text and how it's presented, visual medium relies on a combination of music, animation/choreography, (voice) acting, and the script and storyboard to bring about a desired effect on the viewer. Saying that stylistic elements other than the script is fake is implying that the medium itself is inherently fake because it <em>relies</em> on the additional elements to work.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><!--link--><a href="http://oneofepisodes.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow"><img class="userimg" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/ETFALpg.jpg" /></a></div></td>

<br />
The main issue still stands in that background music obviously does not exist in any said fictional universe, unlike script and choreography and whatnot. Usage of music is fundamentally a deviation from realism, akin to the numerous artistic or literary movements which emphasize elements such as emotion or perception over authenticity. I'm not claiming that it is inherently negative; and more questioning its usage in realistic works.<br />
<br />
This ties in with the original question of the thread. Etymologically speaking, melodrama is simply a combination of melody and drama. This makes sense, because any piece of appropriate music will augment the dramatic tension of a scene, and in other words, exaggerate its feelings. If melodrama can be accused of being overblown and fake, any fiction which makes use of BGM is to an extent melodramatic.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

This question doesn't work when discussing a medium as dynamic as anime, or even film. Anime and film do not solely rely on its script or its storyboard to tell a story.

Well, there's lots to distinguish between the audiovisual from other mediums, such as body language, speech, and actual visuals. Even within the realistic genre, literature and film differ drastically in what they can depict, though we digress.<br />
<br />
The reason you don't hear people call LoGH or Baccano melodrama is probably because<br />
1: they are not the stereotypical tear-jerker pieces commonly associated with melodrama<br />
2: they are good works, and melodrama is usually used pejoratively.<br />
<br />
It seems like people are assigning an inherent negative connotation to the word. I'm just trying to question the dichotomy between melodrama and &quot;proper&quot; drama, since it is my view that most films are melodramatic to an extent.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

Melodrama is by definition exaggerated drama (as you pretty much stated yourself), and while often accompanied by rigid characters, does not inherently entail them.<!--quote--></div><br />
I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this, but just to ensure that what I said is being understood:<br />
<!--quote--><div class="quotetext"><strong>I said:</strong><!--quotesaid--><br>By the book, <strong>it's defined</strong> as &quot;exaggerated and emotional or sentimental; sensational or sensationalized; overdramatic.&quot; <strong>In classic melodrama</strong>, each character fills a singular role and is defined by a single emotional state.<!--quote--></div><br />
The first sentence provides a definition, and the second sentence remarks on characteristics of classic melodrama.  I think it's fair to evaluate subjects for melodrama based on how closely they emulate the form of classic melodrama in addition to considering the most literal definition of melodrama.<br />
<br />
On that note, I'd say that Baccano deviates from classic melodrama by having characters that have some nuance to them.  (Or at the very least, have multiple attributes that are sometimes in conflict with one another.)  For example, Jacuzzi is portrayed as a sniveling wuss prone to frequent bouts of crying, but he also has moments of courage and initiative.  (Or as the episode title puts it, &quot;Jacuzzi Splot Cries, Gets Scared and Musters Reckless Valor.&quot;)<br />
<br />
Claire Stanfield is also an interesting character. His happy-go-lucky demeanor in public seems at odds with his fits of violence during which he mercilessly mutilates the bodies of his victims.  The actions of violent killers tend to be unsympathetic, but Claire targets &quot;bad guys&quot; (people who are threatening the safety of the other train's passengers).  Clearly, Benjamin isn't a good person; both Claire and the audience are well aware of that.  But does that justify torturing him, inflicting pain solely for the sake of inflicting pain?  In classic melodrama you tend to see heroes that are 100% sympathetic paired against villains that are 0% sympathetic.  (Jonathan Joestar versus Dio Brando is a good example of this.)  While Claire isn't exactly a villain, it's difficult to call him a hero.  It's not always clear how we're supposed to feel about his actions.  And for that reason, Baccano seems pretty far from the idea of a classic melodrama.<br />
<br />
Even Ladd Russo is at odds with our melodramatic model.  In melodrama, we're primed to love the hero and hate the villain.  But Ladd Russo is (in my book) a pretty likable character.  Heck, even Dallas (who in the fiction of the Baccano universe is almost uniformly reviled) is a pretty fun character.  Pretty much the only character who is 100% unlikable is Szilard Quates, and he's actually a relatively small part of the drama in Baccano (playing no part in the events on the train in 1931).<br />
<br />
Apart from those few examples, Baccano is thematically segregated from classic melodrama in its framing.  In the first episode, the vice president and his assistant Carol speculate on who might be the &quot;main character&quot; of our story.   Baccano's lack of a clear protagonist is an obvious deviation from classic melodrama.  Fundamentally, melodrama is a form that deals with absolutes.  In Baccano, no one is clearly the main character, no one is absolutely virtuous (&quot;good guy&quot; Jacuzzi is a bootlegger who orders hits on people and &quot;good guy&quot; Firo is deeply entwined in an Italian crime syndicate).</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>
