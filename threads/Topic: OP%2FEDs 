		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message27108097">Basically, if it is even marginally relevant to what's occurring on the screen and is not distracting or inappropriate (e.g. by being abnormally loud or having music of unfitting tones -- though technically one could always just lower the volume), it works. Where the music originated from usually has little to no bearing on how good the actual OST is. Though, quality is mostly consistent throughout a music company or studio.<br />
<br />
Macross Frontier has almost entirely self-produced OST made solely to be put into the show, Legend of the Galactic Heroes basically plays some variance of a classic piece, and Nodame Cantabile incorporates and adapts classic music pieces while inventing some of its own. To say that the one is superior to the rest is... insubstantial. OST is most suitable whenever it reenacts or reinforces some part of the series, and usually has miscellaneous results on how the work is to be perceived. <br />
<br />
The Watamote OP, for instance, is bizarre, crazy, and great. But it doesn't change how poorly executed the series is, if one were to perceive it that way. While, the OST that would be played as the background music during the series may contribute more influentially - since it directly coordinates and orchestrates how the drama is to be perceived by the audience (Berserk's "Gut's Theme," Whisper of the Heart's adaptation of "Country Road," 5 Centimeters per Second's "One more time, one more chance," etc. etc.: they all, by way of their tonal, composition, or lyrical superbness, convey an integral part of the show). However, this really boils down to how shocking, grotesque, or outre the OP is supposed to be (in the case of Elfen Lied: Spooky!), or how reflective and significant the ED should be (in most shows, it's just lax and mundane tones that accompany the credits and gives time to think - an ED that does otherwise has ulterior motives and is thereby more likely to affect the audience positively or negatively).<br />
<br />
There're also OPs and EDs that is sourced from somewhere else, barely has any relevancy to the anime, but can be a hit. Steins; Gate's OP, some of AKB0048's OPs/EDs (I'm not sure), etc. etc. <br />
<br />
All in all, length doesn't matter (it matters how effective the OST can be within its playing time), the most impactful to the series are oftentimes the background music (though the OP or ED may, acting functionally independently or not, be better) , and a horrible music production may or may not affect the anime at all. Personally, I'm very concerning of audiovisuals, more so than most "critics," I would say, and as such, I like my music like my french fries, cooked and well-delivered. Whether or not it comes from a manufacturing company or a freshly-grilled, healthy french fries food shop (do those even exist?) does not matter... until one gets a really terrible case of food poisoning.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

That's p. much it. It rarely amounts to anything, so most of the time it's pretty. That's why if you see sakuga MADs, it wouldn't be a surprise to see a section of the OP/ED. Also, people judge books by their covers so if you see a shitty OP, you might bail out. If it's pretty, you might stay.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to this: I actually don't mind longer OPs if it's actually good-looking. KAs are very underpaid so I don't mind those nerds having fun. Memorable OPs are better than shitty or average ones. There are times where I would watch a show just because it has a cool OP by a musician or animator I like. Yes, it's a dumb idea but I'm like the kawaii-est fangirl ever.<br />
<br />
Random note on OP/ED's suitability to anime if a discussion like that is going to pop up: Madoka's OP is famous for not having any direction from Urobucchi; the happy ClariS OP is Shaft x Simbo's idea, It's a Shaft tradition to make cool OPs that are unrelated to the show. The Pani Poni Dash and Negima OPs are particularly famous for not only having some cool animayshion but being like "wtf cool".</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig">I work in <!--link--><a href="http://vntls.tindabox.net/staff/kastel" rel="nofollow">VNs</a>.

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message27113023">To start off with, I have no idea why they still make EDs. Most of the time they are largely inconsequential to the anime and quite honestly a waste of budget. EDs should be there for you to wrap up the episode. A conclusion to what you watched, a way for you to settle down and reflect on what you've seen. EDs more often than not feel like watching another opening.<br />
<br />
OPs on the other hand are potentially quite useful. OPs can show what the show will be like. You can catch a theme for the show and gain information on the type it's trying to be just from the OP. For example, when you watch something like K-On's OP you know it'll be about 4 girls hanging out and having fun. If you watch something like Monster's OP you know it'll be a thriller, a doctor on the chase and about Johan's background. For someone who's brand new to anime, they will get an impression of the show based on the OP.<br />
<br />
However, I want to ask the thread something. What do you think about people changing the OP/ED formula? For example, in JoJo's Bizarre Adveture you do not see the OP in the first episode and instead the second one. EDs also have been changing recently too. For example in Madoka, you can see people talking over the ED instead of a full drawn out ED. Why do you think this is?<br />

The best kind of OPs use their music and/or animation to set the mood for for the episode and can influence how you are going to approach the show. <br />
<br />
Good EDs on the other hand can get you thinking about what you just watched and will make you crave for the next episode. I especially like EDs where the music starts playing while the episode is still running when it fits the mood of the episode. My favorite ED, Honey &amp; Clover's first ED, does so splendidly and Kyousou Giga's ED usually ends the wow episode with another wow. <br />
<br />
I also really like when shows play with their OP/EDs. Throwing in the OP after half the episode is already over or mixinng up the OP and ED can enhance the fun or even be impactful.<br />
<br />
Overall however, I think OPs or EDs don't have to be relevant to a series (in music or animation) to influence the viewing experience as long as they deliver.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

An example of this would be Cowboy Bebop's opening as not only is it catchy but it perfectly matches the anime's style of 'coolness' with the visuals and the jazz. There are few EDs out there that I actually like as the only thing an ED can do for me is to make me think about the episode I just watched but there are some exceptions to this. Hunter x Hunter(2011)'s second ending song for example, the way it is integrated into the last couple of seconds in the episode and gets me hyped to watch the rest is something I've hardly experienced before.<br />
<br />
The length doesn't matter to me at all really. Basically, I much prefer if the OP/EDs are relevant to the anime because if it's simply a 'catchy' opening alone, then I'll pretty much start a normal episode in an anime with a neutral feeling, no real influence in my experience.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

If it's a good OP I'll let it play but usually switch tabs and do something for a minute, if the OP sucks I just skip it and get on with the episode. <br />
<br />
OPs and EDs don't do anything towards putting me in the mood for the anime or anything like that, the only useful thing they are for is to showcase good animation and <em>sometimes</em> give you an idea of what the show is going to be like.<br />
<br />
<!--quote--><div class="quotetext"><strong>danz said:</strong><!--quotesaid--><br><br />
I also really like when shows play with their OP/EDs. Throwing in the OP after half the episode is already over or mixinng up the OP and ED can enhance the fun or even be impactful.<br />
<br />
Overall however, I think OPs or EDs don't have to be relevant to a series (in music or animation) to influence the viewing experience as long as they deliver.<!--quote--></div><br />

This is one thing that instantly makes me like a show (or at least partially appreciate it). In other words, smooth, flowing transitions. This means OP/EDs especially, and I find it inexcusable that simply because an episode may feature commercials or break away to a certain formula—in this case, OP/EDs—it does not mean that it should cut short, or follow a cookie cutter format. Good fiction is a continuously living and growing reality, and discrete segments are not exactly suitable for that behavior.<br />
<br />
On this note, I must add that Toradora is one of the best examples of natural movement. It always smoothly segues into its ED, and the ED itself remains poppy, charming, but also subtly redolent, and its versatility always add that perfect feeling of longing as it reminds you that the episode is closing. I am totally not kidding. Toradora's transitions? Phenomenal.<br />
<br />
I try not to enjoy OP/EDs as standalone insomuch as how they actually fit into the episodes. Sure, they're by design a marketable product, very much discrete from the rest of the show, and only one component of the OST. But as far as a work goes, its relevance should matter, and when creative touches are added to the standard way OP/EDs are presented, it makes you cherish the work all the more. (This is why I like Aria's OPs too.)</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><div style="text-align: center;"><!--link--><a href="http://myanimelist.net/clubs.php?cid=40791">QD</a><!--center--></div></div></td>

<br />
As already said, OP/EDs have a role in establishing the atmosphere of a work, or closing it, respectively.  I would say this is a fairly important role, especially in this visual medium of anime where presentation is important, and keeping a certain "flow" is more desirable than not.  Needless to say, it is even more important in atmospheric works like Aria.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it is a good illustration of "association", but Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei's final episode with the OP/ED switching sort of does that.  When the OP and ED switch, somewhat definitely feels "different", and yet appropriate for the final episode's climax.<br />
<br />
Lyrics are another point. If they relate to the work, the association of the song is strengthened. It helps if a writer or something is involved (Maeda Jun composing for KEY, for example).<br />
<br />
Anyway, the most outstanding OP/EDs, for me at least, are the ones that constantly cause me to reflect on a work, and that is because of their strong sense of association. Even in my beloved eroge, where OP/EDs are played scarcely due to the lack of an episode format, can an OP/ED be so memorable due to its execution (composition, lyrics, the final event before it, art motif of a cat or surreal god thing, etc.).<br />
<br />
Basically, OP/EDs are in a similar vein to the soundtrack.  And while it is not a really good analogy (a terrible one, at that), a soundtrack might feature unique tracks that only play once in a really important scene. And just because those tracks play only once does not downplay their relevance; it is obviously the opposite.</div><div style="margin-top: 8px;"><em>Modified by opernlied, 12-22-13, 2:09 AM</em></div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig">“But I don’t want to go among mad people," Alice remarked.<br />

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message27151227">I'm of the opinion that OPs help to set the mood of the show, which is why I think they're an important part of the show and not just there to eat up time. They can tell you things about a show before you've even started it, a good example of this is Hajime no Ippo, with its energetic rock soundtrack, it quickly becomes clear that this is going to be a show about manly men doing manly things. Whereas something like Aria's opening is a weird one; the fact that there's no proper transition from the show to actual opening theme makes it feel more like an insert song than an actual opening, but it is very effective at setting up the mood and atmosphere of the show. <br />
 <br />
EDs are a bit of a weird one though, I'm not against them being there, but there are times that I do wish that the spot being used for an ED would be used more effectively (assuming that there's good reason to do so). Then again, if the ED that is being used is something good, I'm all for that being used in the actual show. Of course, unlike OPs there usually isn't much there that can tell you a lot of information about the show, EDs should really be used to round off the show or episode effectively. They should also probably fit tonally with the show too, like Honey and Clover's ending theme which is somewhat thematically appropriate to the series. <br />
<br />
I think OP/EDs are also helped out by effective animation, shows that have animation that really works together with the music can be an engaging watch, moreso than just good music. Higashi no Eden's effective usage of the paper cutouts that it uses (I'm unsure of the correct terminology for it) is an incredibly dynamic usage of both the animation and the music to showcase something truly special. Contrast this with something like the ending of Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory, which has great music but has animation that is little more than a rotating planet, and you can probably understand why it is I'd rather be doing something else in the nearly two minutes that it takes to play.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

Directly jumping into a show without listening to the Op's really feels a bit awkward to me and it usually takes a few minutes for me to get in the mood. Other than this Ops are definitely used to present an anime. Most people give animes a chance just based on the opening. If it sounds and looks good. The chances of viewing the anime is higher. <br />
   <br />
    I think the Eds are there to encourage people to look at the credits at the end of the anime. Although they might seem to have little value I think it does play a little part in the quality of an anime. If the anime transitions well into the ending and the ending sounds great. Then you might have a better chance of viewing the next episode. It would feel really weird to me if an episode had just ended and it just directly goes to the commercials.(or the next episode, depending on what you are watching from.) Ed's definitely don't play a significant role in anime. But i think it still has its purposes for existing.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig">Memories may fade, but that doesn't mean there isn't any point in making them.</div></td>

Sometimes they do have a consistent tone within the show such as a happy, upbeat song in a Magical girl anime or a deep, dark, heavy rock song in a horror or action title. But what makes them really important is how those songs invoke some kind of emotion whenever we think about a particular show. Like when you listen to an opening, it has been stuck into your head for so long after listening to it with each continuing episode that you gain some sort of nostalgic feeling to how much you loved watching it.<br />
<br />
In America, we often shorten out the opening songs because of TV schedule conflicts that might indefinitely happen. So it's debatable over whether the length of a certain opening or ending is of an importance to how it is implemented because of differences between cultural entertainment in certain parts of the world.</div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><div style="text-align: center;"><!--link--><a href="http://gonzonyan.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"><img class="userimg" data-src="http://i.minus.com/iFBKqTvDcfeI1.png" /></a><!--center--></div></div></td>

<br />
These are my thoughts exactly.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, 99% of the time, OPs/EDs in anime suck. Even if the video accompanying the song is really cool or whatever, if the song itself is bad then it ruins the whole thing. And I am really sick of generic j-pop songs in anime. Of course so many people seem to like them. Shit like TM Revolution which is without a doubt one of the worst groups in Japanese music, yet also one of the most popular.<br />
Anyway, I'm ranting a bit here.<br />
<br />
But yeah, it's all about presentation for me. OPs/EDs are just a part of a bigger picture, that being the overall presentation. They should be consistent with the show itself in terms of themes, mood, style, all that. Unfortunately, most of the time they are just promotional tools. Both for the musicians, and for the show itself. It is very successful in this way too, though creatively it's one of the worst things ever.<br />
<br />
My favourite OPs/EDs in anime (I've probably missed a few important ones, but w/e):<br />
<br />
Aku no Hana - you may intensely dislike the show, but presentation-wise this show is excellent. The first time the ED played in episode 1, I had chills down my spine. It was incredible. Also the minimalist imagery accompanying both the OP and ED is a perfect choice. Especially with the ED - it gives you time to take in what you have just seen (unless you hate the show, in which case you've probably already quit playback). The changing up of the OP I see as a creative decision, to reflect the show's schizophrenic nature. And given that the song is created for the show itself, the lyrics are basically taken straight from Kasuga's mind. Anyway, both OP and ED worked completely for me here.<br />
<br />
Black Lagoon - Pretty simple really, OP pumps you up, gets your blood boiling, shows a lot of Revy looking badass, is an awesome song. ED is completely the opposite. A beautiful, haunting tune, and just Revy walking slowly beside the ocean. The feeling I get from watching the ED is profound. It might be my fave ED.<br />
<br />
Cowboy Bebop - do I need to say anything? One of the greatest opening themes in TV history. The ED is wonderful too, of course.<br />
<br />
Detroit Metal City - well, the OP is one of the band's songs, so I think that says enough. The ED is a french sunshine pop song about bread or something. That is all.<br />
<br />
Elfen Lied - the show sucks balls, we all know that. But I won't deny the effort that went into the OP and ED. The OP itself is a marvel. A beautiful song that deserves much better. The imagery that accompanies it is d33p but whatever, they had the right intention. The ED, you may think, is some shitty j-pop song. Well, it's not. It's a well-written but generic j-pop song. It's damn catchy. Anyway, it is in direct contrast to the OP. Basically the OP covers the dark and incredibly sad aspect of the show, while the ED is the typical harem hijinks side of things. Simple, but it works. As for the ED's accompanying imagery, I can't remember. But it's the ED so it doesn't matter as much, in terms of visuals.<br />
<br />
Gankutsuou - The guy who composed half of the OST for this show is an awesome French guy and he also wrote the OP and ED. Like Elfen Lied, each plays on a different theme of the show. The OP is a sad piano ballad, and a really beautiful one at that with some absolutely gorgeous animation accompanying it. The ED is the revenge theme in a nutshell.<br />
<br />
Lupin the Third: The Woman Called Mine Fujiko - The OP is unreal. An avant-garde approach both visually and musically. And then when it suddenly becomes a jazz song in Cowboy Bebop vein to launch you into the episode. That is just amazing. The ED is not particularly outstanding iirc, though I recall it being a good song. The visuals are just Fujiko as a weird kid-adult hybrid thing. Is it consistent in the context of the show though? yes. And after that OP, you can just relax with your ED.<br />
<br />
Mushishi - very simple, discreet, and perfectly suitable. The OP is a pleasant folk pop song accompanying simplistic imagery that recalls the forests and mountains you are about to become immersed in. The ED is a piano tune that changes every episode, with I think just minimalist imagery. Some of the ED songs are special, most are merely pleasant. But all are atmospheric, and the show needs nothing more.<br />

The Tatami Galaxy - opernlied mentioned this already, but it needs to be mentioned anyway. The OP song didn't strike me as anything special at first, but it has since grown on me. The animation for it is basically in the style of the show, which is awesome. What is really special here is the ED though. An amazing song, with an amazing animation to go with it. But the best thing about it is the transition from the clock windback of every episode to the ED itself. It's just so damn exciting. Plus, reversing them in the last episode. Just perfect.<br />
