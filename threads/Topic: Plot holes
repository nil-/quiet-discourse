In stories such as detective mysteries, there is a heavy reliance placed on how logical a character's inferences and/or actions are actually founded on. Once in a while, whether insignificant or enormous, there is a gap which utterly confounds the plot. How significant is this on one's judgment of the work? Should one willingly suspend their disbelief?<br />

In some series such as Code Geass, it was so wildly enjoyable that I didn't care about plot holes or it making complete sense. Now that show was entertainment at its finest! However, the more serious a show takes itself, the more I am bothered by plot holes. If a show is dead serious like most Gundam in the Universal Century then mishaps don't fly. <br />
<br />
Recently a show that bothered me was The Eccentric Family. The professor said something close to, "I love animals so I want to eat them." I thought, "What kind of logic is that!" Another show was Shiki, where it took the majority of the characters more than half the series to begin to warm up to the notion that something may be awry in their town. </div><div style="margin-top: 8px;"><em>Modified by Nagisa33, 02-21-14, 7:26 PM</em></div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message28857583">I somewhat agree with Nagisa in that plot holes don't deter enjoyment to a large extent in some shows. These aren't necessarily "over the top" or run on cartoon logic; I think it depends on what the focus of the show is. An example is the Steins;Gate movie, which is probably jumbled with plotholes in addition to being dead serious. But since the movie's primary purpose is to further develop relationships between characters rather than showcasing cool time traveling, the plot holes can be forgiven. <div class="spoiler"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.nextSibling.nextSibling.style.display='block';this.style.display='none';" value="Show spoiler"> <span class="spoiler_content" style="display:none"><input type="button" class="button" onClick="this.parentNode.style.display='none';this.parentNode.parentNode.childNodes[0].style.display='block';" value="Hide spoiler"><br>Not to mention that the time traveling is such a pile of interpretable crap that you can never be sure whether there is a plot hole, as 10 other people will then come up with 11 different theories to explain why it's logically consistent. Who in their right minds watch Steins;Gate for time traveling anyway? They put so much effort into explaining something which has no scientific consistency whatsoever. <!--spoiler--></span></div><br />
Of course, detecting any plot hole while watching a show breaks immersion. Plotholes can be forgiven only if they're next to unnoticable unless examined carefully (if it's extremely minor or too complex). I don't agree with the example of Code Geass though. It relies on the characters' tactical expertise for a large chunk of its enjoyment, and the lapse in judgement shown by many of them really do take away from the enjoyment (though I still love it). <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, whereas plotholes sometimes don't detract from enjoyment, they still make the shows objectively worse. Not much to say or argue about here except for the pointless argument of whether objective evaluations are possible or relevant.<br />
<br />
An exception to the above is when plot holes are used consciously in shows. This can be seen in comedies such as Teekyu where absurdities are utilized for comical effect. Another example is Gurren Lagann, which consciously breaks logic to do the impossible and see the invisible. The problem here is whether intended "plot holes" can even be considered plot holes anymore.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

Love does bizarre things to most people and they often go about expressing it in many different ways, whether they seem rationally justified or not. <br />
<br />
Ultimately I think it comes down to what can be considered a plot hole or not. There are anime/manga that seem like they have several unexplained "plot holes" only for them to pull a fast one and explain them and potentially blow your mind with them. It usually comes down to their intended purpose.<br />
<br />
That's not to say that all plot holes are like that, several anime and manga finish up with absolutely no explanation to any of their plot holes and that does actively derail the experience. Then there's the issue of adaptation induced plot holes, with Berserk rushing to the front of my mind. With the absence of the Skull Knight in the anime, how exactly does Guts survive the Eclipse? There's no explanation given to it. Granted, reading the manga rectifies this but it's an issue that managed to hamper my experience with the anime of Berserk and completely ruined my immersion. <br />
<br />
What about filler induced plot holes as well? Long running shounen shows usually have this issue, and in the writers' haste to extend the storyline in order to fill for time whilst the source material continues, they usually show up. One Piece had a couple of odd plot holes that were strictly anime only and the manga isn't too kind on them as a result.<br />
<br />
Yeah, plot holes are odd.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

Just to throw one more into the batch. like, who even watched CG for a realistic depiction of a superhuman, precocious teenager conquering the universe via a green head alien girl who just so happens to grant him some strange will. From episode one and its reputation, I expected nothing out of CG but bombast. And am I to complain because there wasn't more? that would be ludicrous. <br />
<br />
Plot holes are usually caused in consequence to Deus ex Machina, and while those are sometimes forgivable, there is an extent to which it gets excessive. There is a common misconception, though, that things unexplained automatically equate to plot holes. While it does mean that the work will be less concrete and more interpretable, occasionally it adds to... the experience. Ambiguity and obfuscations can be good, and it really depends on the work and its purpose of using cryptic things. Just because something wasn't definitively incorporated into the story doesn't necessarily make it nonexistent; it could be implied or strongly hinted at. Again, it really depends.<br />
<br />
I love Steins Gate beyond a universe above the infinite stratus of earth, but it simply isn't discernible to say that there aren't as many holes as there are times that Mayoii says "Tuturu~" or even Kurisu blushing. This is because SG analyzes time travel in a manner which doesn't match up with the empirical evidences of quantum physics thus far. Perhaps in the near future these plot holes will be substantiated and "legitimized". But for now they remain to be thought-provoking albeit unscientific elements of SG. Sci Fi in general struggles with this, and that's because Sci Fi mostly seeks to explore the potentials or consequences of technology, and not what it's already capable of.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>

I love Code Geass to bits and pieces; it's my gateway show, dealt with a lot of themes, has a relatively solid plot and a fantastic cast of characters (I'll never, EVER get sick of Lelouch casting Geass. Seriously, you have no idea how many times I'd come back in a bad mode, open my laptop and watch him do that, making my day way better in the process).<br />
<br />
But part of why I loved Code Geass so much, which I often connect to why we often ignore moments of questionable writing in shows, is that if a show connects to us, or delivers a message we can relate to and connect to, then we can ignore all sorts of flaws (in this case plot holes) a show would have. Guilty Crown is an example of a series that tried to be what Code Geass was to a lot of people. And yet, people were more harsh on Guilty Crown and constantly openly ridiculing the show, in-spite of it suffering from some of the VERY SAME problems as Code Geass in its plot. Some people would use being overly entertaining as an argument, but I feel that any show which succeeds in getting its message or appealing in its message to a wide audience is more likely to be loved than a show which doesn't.<br />

<br />
For example, if I watch an anime episode and a character's actions don't make sense, I think for a long time and come up with a lengthy justification on why the character would act that way. If it's something that isn't logical in our universe, I make sure to fill in the rest of the anime universe so that everything works out. With research and a ton of roundabout thinking, however, most plot holes can be filled, so after proper justification, I don't mind them too much. However, any plot holes end up to be very time consuming with this method, so I always prefer my anime without. Unfortunately, it's practically impossible to have a good scifi or supernatural anime without some plot holes... only then can the anime blow your mind.<br />
<br />
Let me use the example of "I love animals so I want to eat them." There is, of course, the explanation that love is a strange thing. But in case that's not enough, I'd say that the world is a cruel place to animals, so eating them is like putting them out of misery, so the character loves animals, and has this somewhat twisted logic, so wants to eat animals. </div><div class="postActions"></div><div class="sig"><!--link--><a href="http://myanimelist.net/animelist/einonymous&amp;sclick=1"><img class="userimg" data-src="http://myanimelist.net/signature/einonymous.png" /></a> </div></td>

		  <td class="forum_boardrow1" style="border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;" valign="top"><div id="message28944383">I think it's worth discussing the definition of "plot hole," because there seems to be some disagreement within this thread over what a plot hole is.  My own view is as follows:<br />
<br />
Ambiguity is not a plot hole.  Intentionally withholding information from the audience is not a plot hole.  Leaving unanswered questions at the end of a show is not a plot hole.  In fact, a good story will nearly always have moments of ambiguity, moments where it does not lay all of its cards on the table.<br />
<br />
So what is a plot hole?  A plot hole can most simply be described as a contradiction.  Some contradictions are overt, such as a character breaking both legs, and then somehow managing to sprint away immediately shortly after.  Some contradictions are a bit more subtle, such as someone behaving out of character.  And omissions can often point to an inconsistency of character.<br />
<br />
For example, one common "plot hole" complaint I hear is "There was an easy way to solve the problem, and the characters didn't choose the easy solution."  That in and of itself is not a contradiction.  However, "The main character is portrayed as a brilliant mastermind who accounts for every contingency, but he somehow managed to ignore the easy solution" <em>is</em> a contradiction, because what we know about the character (his brilliant mind) contradicts the events of the story (he somehow misses the obvious solution).  It's perfectly valid for the story to address this with an explanation, such as "The character was so caught up in his more complicated plans and in love with his own genius machinations that arrogance made him oblivious to the obvious solution."  But to offer no explanation for why a rational actor would ignore an easy solution that is obvious to the viewer is a contradiction, albeit a non-explicit one.<br />
<br />
Going by my own definition, I consider plot holes unforgivable.  And if you look at examples of "cartoon logic" like Kill la Kill, you'll notice that they are internally consistent.  Yeah, KLK is pretty ridiculous, but it establishes pretty clear rules for things like how the clothing works and sticks to them.  Even late revelations are presented as, "Things were always this way; they contradict your current understanding, but that's because your prior understanding was incomplete," and usually implicit in that understanding is why the old paradigm was incomplete.  Even an outlandish show like Nichijou has its own rules, making it easy to hand-wave things like the fact that a small child possesses the brilliance required to construct a fully-functional android.  Note that while Nichijou does not allow you to expect the universe at large to behave in a predictable manner, the characters generally do behave in a predictable manner: Yuko is a lazy spaz, Mai is quiet and has a rather eccentric brand of humor, the professor behaves like a young child, etc.  Thus, it is perfect acceptable for Nano's arm to pop off and reveal wheat chaff, but it would be unacceptable for Mai to engage in a chatty conversation about her interest in fashion and complain about the fact that she doesn't have boyfriend.  It doesn't matter whether the show follows real-world logic; all that is necessary is that it obey its own logic.</div><div class="postActions"></div></td>
